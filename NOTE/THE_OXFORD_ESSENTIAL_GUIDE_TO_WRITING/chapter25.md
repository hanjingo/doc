# Chapter 25. Clarity and Simplicity

That is more complicated than it sounds. It is not simply a question of deciding what you perceive or think or know or feel, and then of choosing appropriate words.

To be more exact, the two processes--thinking, knowing, seeing, feeling, on the one hand; and using words, on the other--vitalize one another.

`Diction-word choice-then`, is the heart of writing.

`Abstract` words signify things that cannot be directly perceived: `honor`, for instance, is an abstract word, as are `generosity` or `idea` or `democracy`. Concrete words refer to perceptible things: `a rose`, `a clap of thunder`, `the odor of violets`.

Aside from being concrete or abstract, words may also be general or specific. On the other hand, there is nothing inherently wrong wth general words.

Ambiguity means that a word can be read in either of two ways and the context does not make clear which way is intended.

Large abstractions are often ambiguous, particularly if they involve value judgments. Words like `democracy`, `romantic`, and `Christian` encompass a wide range of meanings, some of them contradictory.

The connotation of a word is its fringe or associated meanings, including implications of approval or disapproval.
