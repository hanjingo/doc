# CHAPTER7. Drafts and Revisions

As a rule, the more you draft, the better the result.

A good deal of improvement can be made in that draft. First, though, it would help to say something about revision in general.

To revise effectively, force yourself to read slowly.

The revisions are toward precision, emphasis, and economy.
