# CHAPTER 28 Unusual Words and Collocations

A `collocation` is a group of words considered as a unit of meaning.

Uncommonness may reside not so much in the rarity of the word itself, as in the meaning it carries.

`Neologisms` constitute a special class of rare words.

Such construction are called `nonce compounds`, which are distinct from the conventional compounds we all use, like `teenager` or `schoolboy`.

An unusual collocation is an unlikely combination of words, each commonplace in itself but rarely used with the other.

When the oddity of a collocation becomes seemingly contradictory, it is called an `oxymoron`.

A `rhetorical paradox` is an oxymoron writ large.

`Accumulation`, as we use it here, means stringing together a number of words, all the same part of speech and grammatically parallel, that is, connected to the same thing.
