# CHAPTER2. Strategy and Style



`Style` is immediate and obvious. It exists in the writing itself; it is the sum of the actual words, sentences, paragraphs. `Strategy` is more abstract, felt beneath the words as the imediate ends they serve. `Purpose` is even deeper, supporting strategy and involving not only what you write about but how you affect readers.

The persuasive purpose is also reflected in the writer's strategy of short emphatic sentences.

These strategies are effectively realized in the style: in the clear rhetorical questions, each immediately followed by a straightforward answer; and in the short uncomplicated sentences, echoning speech. At the same time the sentences are sufficiently varied to achieve a strategy fundamental to all good prose--to get and hold the reader's attention.

Remember several things about strategy. First, it is manysided. Any piece of prose displays not one but numerous strategies--of organization, of sentence structure, of word choice, of point of view, of tone. In effective writing these reinforce one another.

Second, no absolute one-to-one correspondence exists between strategy and purposes.
