# CHAPTER 27 Figurative Language

A simile is a brief comparison, usually introduced by `like` or `as`.

A simile consists of two parts: tenor and vehicle.

An `image` is a word or expression referring to something we can perceive.

All good writing gives pleasure. But figurative language is a special delight. 

Like a simile, a metaphor is also a comparison. The difference is that a simile compares things explicitly; it literally says that `X` is like `Y`.

A metaphore has the same two parts as a simile: tenor--or the main subject--and vehicle--the image introduced for comparison.

Metaphors have the same functions as similes. Metaphors also enrich meaning by implying added dimensions of thought or feeling.

There is no formula for creating metaphors. Another source of metaphor is metonymy, which describes something in terms of an associated quality.

`personification`, really a special kind of metaphor, is referring to inanimate things or to abstractions as if they were human.

An allusion is a brief reference to a well-known person, place, or happening.

Irony consists of using words in a sense very different from their usual meaning. The simplest case occurs when a term is given its opposite value.

The rhetorical name for overstatement is `hyperbole`, from a Greek word meaning "excess".

Understatement stresses importance by seeming to deny it. Like overstatement it can be comic or serious.

A pun is a word employed in two or more senses, or a word used in a context that suggests a second term sounding like it.

zeugma is a special kind of pun involving a verb used with two or more objects, but with a difference of meaning.

An image is a word or expression that speaks directly to one or more of the senses. Images are classified according to the sense to which they primarily appeal. Visual images, like those in the sentence above, are the most common.
