# CHAPTER 10 Organizing the Middle

An important part of a writer's job is assisting readers in following the organization. It can be done in two ways:

1. by sign-posts-words, phrases, sentences (occasionally even a short paragraph) which tells readers what you have done, are doing will do next, or even will not do at all.

2. by `interparagraph transitions`, that is, words and phrases that tie the beginning of a new paragraph to what precedes it.

## Signposts

Sequence may be signaled by actual numbers or letters usually enclosed in parentheses--rather than by words like `first`, `second`, `in the first place`, and so on.

Numbers, however, and number words like `first`, `second`, `third`, must be handled cautiously. Overused, they confuse readers, losing them in a labyrinth of `(1)s` and `(2)s` and `(a)s` and `(b)s`.

Rather than using numbers, it is better, if possible, to set up an analysis by employing key terms. These identify the major points and can be repeated at the beginning of the appropriate paragraph or section.
