# CHAPTER 23 The Well-Written Sentence(4): Variety

`Recurrence` means repeating a basic sentence pattern. `Variety` means changing the pattern.

Sometimes variation in length can be used to emphasize a key idea.

Fragments, usually a special kind of short sentence, make for effective variation--easy to see and easy to use.

Like fragments or any other kind of unusual sentence, rhetorical questions are rarely used for variety alone.

Interruption--positioning a modifier or even a second, independent sentence between main elements of a clause so that pauses are required on either side of the intruder--nicely varies straightforward movement.
