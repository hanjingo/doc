# Chapter 26. Concision

`Verbal profundity` is the fallacy that words which look impressive must mean a lot.

Closely related to verbal profundity is the desire for `false elegance`, often a variety of what in the last chapter we called pretentious diction.

It helps to keep a list of pairs like `explicit` and `implicit` which enable you to make distinctions quickly and neatly: `extrinsic/intrinsic`, `concrete/abstract`, `actual/ideal`, `absolute/relative` are other examples.

In practice, they are manifested in either of two ways: `circumlocution`, using too many words to say something; and `pointlessness`, saying something that doesn't need to be said at all.

Pointlessness words serve o pupose. They do not need to be made more concise; they need to be eliminated. There are two broad causes of pointless diction: 

1. failing to credit readers' intelligence.
2. failing to focus on the subject.

Avoid Empty Redundancy, empty redundancy is pointless repetition. It is ofen found in headwords and modifiers.

A pointless distinction is naming several varieties of something when those varieties do not matter for your purpose.
