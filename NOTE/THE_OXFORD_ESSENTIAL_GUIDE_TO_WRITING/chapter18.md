# CHAPTER 18 The Sentence: A Definition

The second type of sentence (Finally in our example) does not contain a subject and verb and is called a `fragment`.

Grammatical independence simply means that the words constituting the sentence are not acting as a noun or modifier or verb in connection with any other word or words.

The heart of a grammatical sentence is the subject and predicate. In a narrow sense the subject is the word or words identifying who or what the sentence is about, and the predicate is the verb, expressing something about the subject. In a broader sense, the subject includes the subject word(s) plus all modifiers, and the predicate includes the verb together with its objects and modifiers.

A phrase is a functional word group that does not contain a subject-finite verb combination, although some phrases do use nonfinite verb forms. We can distinguish five kinds of phrases: verb, prepositional, participial, gerundive, and infinitive.

A clause is a functional word group that does contain a subject and a finite verb. There are two basic clauses--independent and dependent.

An absolute is something more than a functional word group but less than a sentence. It is connected by idea but not through grammar to the rest of the statement in which it occurs: 

```txt
She flew down the stairs, her children tumbling after her.
```

Depending on the number and type of clauses they contain, grammatical sentences fall into three patterns: the simple, the compound, and the complex. In addition, there are compound-complex sentences, though they are not truly basic.

A compound sentence consists of at least two independent subject-verb nexuses:

```txt
The children laughed, and their parents were glad.
```

A complex sentence contains on independent clause and at least one dependent clause.

A compound-complex sentence must have at least two independent clauses and at least one dependent.



## Summary

1. A sentence is a group of words (and sometimes a single word) that makes sense standing alone.
2. Some sentences are grammatically complete; others--called fragments--are not.
3. Grammatical sentences must satisfy three criteria: they must (a)be grammatically independent, (b)have a subject and a finite verb, and (c)be properly constructed.
4. The parts of a sentence are subject, verb, object, and modifier.
5. These parts may be filled by single words or by functional word groups.
6. Functional word groups act grammatically as though they were one word. They include phrases and dependent clauses.
7. A phrase does not contain a subject-finite verb combination, though it may have a subject and a nonfinite verb form, either a participle or an infinitive.
8. There are several kinds of phrases--verb phrases, prepositional, participial, gerundive, and infinitive.
9. Clauses may be independent or dependent. Only dependent clauses act as functional word groups.
10. Dependent clauses are classified according to their grammatical role as noun, adverbial, or adjectival clauses.
11. An absolute is more than a functional word group but less than a sentence. It is related in idea but not in grammar to the rest of the sentence in which it occurs.
12. Grammatical sentences come in three basic types--simple, compound, and complex--plus a combination of the last two, the compound-complex sentence.
