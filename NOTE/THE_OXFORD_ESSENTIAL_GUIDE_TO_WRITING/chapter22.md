# CHAPTER 22 The Well-Written Sentence(3): Rhythm

Rhythm is effective when it pleases the ear.

Poor rhythm usually results from either or both of two causes: 1. the sentence is not organized so that phrases and clauses create a pattern out of which rhythm can evolve; 2. syllables are poorly grouped, being either so irregular that no pattern at all can be grasped, or so unrelievedly regular that a steady, obtrusive beat overrides everything else.

Good rhythm enters into the meaning of the sentence, not only reinforcing the words but often giving them nuances they might not otherwise have.

Rhyme is the repetition of sounds in positions close enough to be noticed.
