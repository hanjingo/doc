# CHAPTER 9 Closing

There are several ways of terminating:

- Terminal Words: The simplest is to employ a word or phrase like `in conclusion`, `concluding`, `finally`, `lastly`, `in the last analysis`, `to close`, `in clossing`, and so on.

- Circular Closing: The final paragraph repeats an important word or phrase prominent in the beginning, something the reader will remember.

A final way of signaling the end is simply to stop at a natural point, one built into the subject.

Summaries are more likely in long, complicated papers. Usually they are signaled by a phrase like `in summary`, `to sum up`, `summing up`, `in short`, `in fine`, `to recapitulate`.
