# 13 Dependability engineering

[TOC]



Dependability engineering is concerned with the techniques that are used to enhance the dependability of both critical and non-critical systems. These techniques support three complementary approaches that are used in developing dependable software:

1. Fault avoidance
2. Fault detection and correction
3. Fault tolerance
