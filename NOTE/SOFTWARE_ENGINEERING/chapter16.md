*The reuse landscape*

key factors that you should consider when planning reuse are:

1. The development schedule for the software.
2. The expected software lifetime.
3. The background, skills, and experience of the development team.
4. The criticality of the software and its non-functional requirements.
5. The application domain.
6. The platform on which the system will run.
