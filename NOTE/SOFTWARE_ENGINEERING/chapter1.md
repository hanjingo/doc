# Chapter 1 Introduction

[TOC]



Many of these so-called software failures are a consequence of two factors:

1. **Increasing demands.** As new software engineering techniques help us to build larger, more complex systems, the demands change.
2. **Low expectations.** It is relatively easy to write computer programs without using software engineering methods and techniques.

## Professional software development

There are two kinds of software products:

1. `Generic products` These are stand-alone systems that are produced by a development organization and sold on the open market to any customer who is able to buy them.
2. `Customized (or bespoke) products` These are systems that are commissioned by a particular customer.

### Software engineering

Essential attributes of good software:

| Product characteristics    | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Maintainability            | Software should be written in such a way so that it can evolve to meet the changing needs of customers. This is a critical attribute because software change is an inevitable requirement of a changing business environment. |
| Dependability and security | Software dependability includes a range of characteristics, including reliability, security, and safety. Dependable software should not cause physical or economic damage in the event of system failure. Malicious users should not be able to access or damage the system. |
| Efficiency                 | Software should not make wasteful use of system resources such as memory and proessor cycles. Efficiency, therefore includes responsiveness, processing time, memory utilization, etc. |
| Acceptability              | Software must be acceptable to the type of users for which it is designed. This means that it must be understandable, usable, and compatible with other systems that they use. |

Software engineering definition:

1. `Engineering discipline:` Engineers make things work.
2. `All aspects of software production,` Software engineering is not just concerned with the technical processes of software development.

There are four fundamental activities that are common to all software processes. These activities are:

1. Software specification, where customers and engineers define the software that is to be produced and the constraints on its operation.
2. Software development, where the software is designed and programmed.
3. Software validation, where the software is checked to ensure that it is what the customer requires.
4. Software evolution, where the software is modified to reflect changing customer and market requirements.



## Software engineering ethics

1. Confidentiality
2. Competence
3. Intellectual property rights
4. Computer misuse



## KEY POINTS

- Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production.
- Software is not just a program or program but also includes documentation. Essential software product attributes are maintainability, dependability, security, efficiency, and acceptability.
- The software process includes all of the activities involved in software development. The high-level activities of specification, development, validation, and evolution are part of all software processes.
- The fundamental notions of software engineering are universally applicable to all types of system development. These fundamentals include software processes, dependability, security, requirements, and reuse.
- There are many different types of systems and each requires appropriate software engineering tools and techniques for their development. There are few, if any, specific design and implementation techniques that are applicable to all kinds of systems.
- The fundamental ideas of software engineering are applicable to all types of software systems. These fundamentals include managed software processes, software dependability and security, requirements engineering, and software reuse.
- Software engineers have responsibilities to the engineering profession and society. They should not simply be concerned with technical issues.
- Professional societies publish codes of conduct that set out the standards of behavior expected of their members.
