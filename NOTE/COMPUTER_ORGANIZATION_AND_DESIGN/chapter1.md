**server** A computer used for running larger programs for multiple users, often simultaneously, and typically accessed only via a network.

**embedded computer** A computer inside another device used for running one predetermined application or collection of software.

**Personal mobile devices (PMDs)** are small wireless devices to connect to the Internet; they rely on batteries for power, and software is installed by downloading apps. Conventional examples are smart phones and tablets.

**Cloud Computing** refers to large collections of servers that provide services over the Internet; some providers rent dynamically varying numbers of servers as a utility.

**Software as a Service (SaaS)** delivers software and data as a service over the Internet, usually via a thin program such as a browser that runs on local client devices, instead of binary code that must be installed, and runs wholly on that device.
