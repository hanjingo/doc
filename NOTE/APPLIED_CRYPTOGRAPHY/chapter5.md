## ZERO-KNOWLEDGE PROOFS

### Generalities

There are also different kinds of zero-knowledge proofs:

- **Perfect**. There is a simulator that gives transcripts identically distributed to real transcripts.
- **Statistical**. There is a simulator that gives transcripts identically distributed to real transcripts, except for some constant number of exceptions.
- **Computational**. There is a simulator that gives transcripts indistinguishable from real transcripts.
- **No-use**. A simulator may not exist, but we can prove that Victor will not learn any polynomial amount of information from the proof.



## IDENTITY-BASED PUBLIC-KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY

**Identity-based cryptosystems**, sometimes called Non-Interactive Key Sharing(NIKS) systems.
