# Words and Expressions Commonly Misused

`Aggravate. Irritate.` The first means "to add to" an already troublesome or vexing matter or condition. The second means "to vex" or "to annoy" or "to chafe".

`All right.` Idiomatic in familiar speech as a detached phrase in the sense "Agreed," or "Go ahead," or "O.K." Properly written as two words--all right.

`Allude.` Do not confuse with elude. You allude to a book; you elude a pursuer. Note, too, that allude is not synonymous with refer. An allusion is an indirect mention, a reference is a specific one.

`Allusion`. Easily confused with illusion. The first means "an indirect reference"; the second means "an unreal image" or "a false impression."

`Alternate. Alternative.` The words are not always interchangeable as nouns or adjectives. The first means every other one in a series; the second, one of two possibilities. As the other one of a series of two, an alternate may stand for "a substitute," but an alternative, although used in a similar sense, connotes a matter of choice that is never present with an alternate.

`Among. Between.` When more than two things or persons are involved, among is usually called for: "The money was divided among the four players." When, however, more than two are involved but each is considered individually, between is preferred: "an agreement between the six heirs."

`And/or.` A device, or shortcut, that damages a sentence and often leads to confusion or ambiguity.

`Anticipate.` Use expect in the sense of simple expectation.

`Anybody.` In the sense of "any person," not to be written as two words. Any body means "any corpse," or "any human form," or "any group." The rule holds equally for everybody, nobody, and somebody.

`Anyone.` In the sense of "anybody," written as one word. Any one means "any single person" or "any single thing."

`As good or better than.` Expressions of this type should be corrected by rearranging the sentences.

`As to whether.` Whether is sufficient.

`As yet.` Yet nearly always is as good, if not better.

`Being.` Not appropriate after regard...as.

`But.` Unnecessary after doubt and help.

`Can.` Means "an (is, are) able." Not to be used as a substitute for may.

`Careless.` The dismissive "I couldn't care less" is often used with the shortened "not" mistakenly (and mysteriously) omitted: "I could care less." The error destroys the meaning of the sentence and is careless indeed.

`Case.` Often unnecessary.

`Certainly.` used indiscriminately by some speakers, much as others use very, in an attempt to intensify any and every statement. A mannerism of this kind, bad in speech, is even worse in writing.

`Character.` Often simply redundant, used from a mere habit of wordiness.

`Claim (verb).` With object-noun, means "lay claim to." May be used with a dependent clause if this sense is clearly intended: "She claimed that she was the sole heir." (But even here claimed to be would be better.) Not to be used as a substitute for declare, maintain, or charge.

`Clever.` Note that the word means one thing when applied to people, another when applied to horses. A clever horse is a good-natured one, not an ingenious one.

`Compare.` To compare to is to point out or imply resemblances between objects regarded as essentially of a different order; to compare with is mainly to point out differences between objects regarded as essentially of the same order. Thus, life has been compared to a pilgrimage, to a drama, to a battle; Congress may be compared with the British Parliament. Paris has been compared to ancient Athens; it may be compared with modern London.

`Comprise.` Literally, "embrace": A zoo comprises mammals, reptiles, and birds (because it "embraces," or "includes," them). But animals do not comprise ("embrace") a zoo--they constitute a zoo.

`Consider.` Not followed by as when it means "believe to be."

`Contact.` As a transitive verb, the word is vague and self-important. Do not contact people; get in touch with them, look them up, phone them, find them, or meet them.

`Cope.` An intransitive verb used with `with`. In formal writing, one doesn't "cope," one "copes with" something or somebody.

`Currently.` In the sense of now with a verb in the present tense, currently is usually redundant; emphasis is better achieved through a more precise reference to time.

`Data.` Like strata, phenomena, and media, data is a plural and is best used with a plural verb. The world, however, is slowly gaining acceptance as a singular.

`Different than.` Here logic supports established usage: one thing differs from another, hence, different from. or, other than, unlike.

`Disinterested.` Means "impartial." Do not confuse it with uninterested, which means "not interested in."

`Divided into.` Not to be misused for composed of. The line is sometimes difficult to draw; doubtless plays are divided into acts, but poems are composed of stanzas. An apple, halved, is divided into sections, but an apple is composed of seeds, flesh, and skin.

`Due to.` Loosely used for through, because of, or owing to, in adverbial phrases.

`Each and every one.` Pitchman's jargon. Avoid, except in dialogue.

`Effect.` As a noun, means "result"; as a verb, means "to bring about," "to accomplish" (not to be confused with affect, which means "to influence").

`Enormity.` Use only in the sense of "monstrous wickedness." Misleading, if not wrong, when used to express bigness.

`Enthuse.` An annoying verb growing out of the noun `enthusiasm`. Not recommended.

`Etc.` Literally, "and other things"; sometimes loosely used to mean "and other persons."

`Fact.` Use this word only of matters capable of direct verification, not of matters of judgment.

`Facility.` Why must jails, hospitals, and schools suddenly become "facilities"?

`Factor.` A hackneyed word; the expressions of which it is a part can usually be replaced by something more direct and idiomatic.

`Farther. Further.` The two words are commonly interchanged, but there is a distinction worth observing: `farther` serves best as a distance word, `further` as a time or quantity word.

`Feature.` Another hackneyed word; like `factor`, it usually adds nothing to the sentence in which it occurs.

`Finalize.` A pompous, ambiguous verb.

`Fix.` Colloquial in America for arrange, prepare, mend.

`Flammable.` An oddity, chiefly useful in saving lives.

`Folk.` A collective noun, equivalent to people.

`Fortuitous.` Limited to what happens by chance. Not to be used for `fortunate` or `lucky`.

`Get.` The colloquial `have` got for `have` should not be used in writing.

`Gratuitous.` Means "unearned," or "unwarranted."

`He is a man who.` A common type of redundant expression.

`Hopefully.` This once-useful adverb meaning "with hope" has been distorted and is now widely used to mean "I hope" or "it is to be hoped."

`However.` Avoid starting a sentence with `however` when the meaning is "nevertheless." The word usually serves better when not in first position.

`Illusion.` See allusion.

`Imply. Infer.` Not interchangeable. Something implied is something suggested or indicated, though not expressed. Something inferred is something deduced from evidence at hand.

`Importantly.` Avoid by rephrasing.

`in regard to.` Often wrongly written `in regards to`. But `as regards` is correct, and means the same thing.

`In the last analysis.` A bankrupt expression.

`Inside of. Inside.` The of following `inside` is correct in the adverbial meaning "in less than." In other meanings, `of` is unnecessary.

`Insightful.` The word is a suspicious overstatement for "perceptive." If ti is to be used at all, it should be used for instances of remarkably penetrating vision. Usually, it crops up merely to inflate the commonplace.

`In terms of.` A piece of padding usually best omitted.

`Interesting.` An unconvincing word; avoid it as a means of introduction. Instead of announcing that what you are about to tell is interesting, make it so.

`Irregardless.` Should be regardless.

`-ize.` Do not coin verbs by adding this tempting suffix.

`Kind of.` Except in familiar style, not to be used as a substitute for rather or something like.

`Lay.` A transitive verb.

`Leave.` Not to be misused for `let`.

`Less.` Should not be misused for `fewer`.

`Like.` Not to be used for the conjunction `as`. Like governs nouns and pronouns; before phrases and clauses the equivalent word is `as`.

`Line. Along these lines.` `Line` in the sense of "course of procedure, conduct, thought" is allowable but has been so overworked, particularly in the phrase along these lines, that a writer who aims at freshness or originality had better discard it entirely.

`Literal. Literally.` Often incorrectly used in support of exaggeration or violent metaphor.

`Loan.` A noun. As a verb, prefer `lend`.

`Meaningful.` A bankrupt adjective. Choose another, or rephrase.

`Memento.` Often incorrectly written momento.

`Most.` Not to be used for `almost` in formal composition.

`Nature.` Often simply redundant, used like `character`.

`Nauseous. Nauseated.` The first means "sickening to contemplate"; the second means "sick at the stomach." Do not, therefore, say, "I feel nauseous," unless you are sure you have that effect on others.

`Nice.` A shaggy, all-purpose word, to be used sparingly in formal composition.

`Nor.` Often used wrongly for or after negative expressions.

`Noun used as verb.` Many nouns have lately been pressed into service as verbs. Not all are bad, but all are suspect.

`Offputting. Ongoing.` Newfound adjectives, to be avoided because they are inexact and clumsy. `Ongoing` is a mix of "continuing" and "active" and is usually superfluous.

`One.` In the sense of "a person," not to be followed by `his` or `her`.

`One of the most.` Avoid this feeble formula. "One of the most exciting developments of modern science is..."; "Switzerland is one "

`-oriented.` A clumsy, pretentious device, much in vogue. Find a better way of indicating orientation or alignment or direction.

`Partially.` Not always interchangeable with `partly`. Best used in the sense of "to a certain degree," when speaking of a condition or state: "I'm partially resigned to it." `Partly` carries the idea of a condition or state: "I'm partially resigned to it." `partly` carries the idea of a part as distinct from the whole usually a physical object.

`Participle for verbal noun.`

`People.` A word with many meanings. The `people` is a political term, not to be confused with the `public`. From the people comes political support or opposition; from the public comes artistic appreciation or commercial patronage.

  The word `people` is best not used with words of number, in place of `persons`. If of "six people" five went away, how many people would be left? Answer: one people.

`Personalize.` A pretentious word, often carrying bad advice. Do not `personalize` your prose; simply make it good and keep it clean.

`Personally.` Often unnecessary.

`Possess.` Often used because to the writer it sounds more impressive than `have` or `own`. Such usage is not incorrect but is to be guarded against.

`Presently.` Has two meanings: "in a short while" and "currently." Because of this ambiguity it is best restricted to the first meaning: "She'll be here presently" ("soon," or "in a short time").

`Prestigious.` Often an adjective of last resort. It's in the dictionary, but that doesn't mean you have to use it.

`Refer.` See `allude`.

`Regretful.` Sometimes carelessly used for `regrettable`: "The mixup was due to a regretful breakdown in communications."

`Relate.` Not to be used intransitively to suggest rapport.

`Respective. Respectively.` These words may usually be omitted with advantage.

`Secondly, thirdly, etc.` Unless you are prepared to begin with `firstly` and defend it (which will be difficult), do not prettify numbers with `-ly`. Modern usage prefers `second, third`, and so on.

`Shall. Will.` In formal writing, the future tense requires `shall` for the first person, `will` for the second and third.

`So.` Avoid, in writing, the use of so as an intensifier: "so good"; "so warm"; "so delightful."

`Sort of.` See `kind of`.

`Split infinitive.` There is precedent from the fourteenth century down for interposing an adverb between to an the infinitive it governs, but the construction should be avoided unless the writer wishes to place unusual stress on the adverb.

`State.` Not to be used as a mere substitute for `say, remark`. Restrict it to the sense of "express fully or clearly": "He refused to state his objections."

`Student body.` nine times out of ten a needless and awkward expression, meaning no more than the simple word `students`.

`Than.` Any sentence with `than`(to express comparison) should be examined to make sure no essential words are missing.

`Thanking you in advance.` This sounds as if the writer meant, "It will not be worth my while to write to your again." In making your request, write "Will you please," or "I shall be obliged." Then, later, if you feel moved to do so, or if the circumstances call for it, write a letter of acknowledgment.

`That. Which.` `That` is the defining, or restrictive, pronoun, `which` the nondefining, or nonrestrictive.

`The foreseeable future.` A cliche, and a fuzzy one.

`The truth is... The fact is... A` bad beginning for a sentence. If you feel you are possessed of the truth, or of the fact, simply state it. Do not give it advance billing.

`They. He or She.` Do not use `they` when the antecedent is a distributive expression such as `each, each one, everybody, every one, many a man.` Use the singular pronoun.

`This.` The pronoun `this`, referring to the complete sense of a preceding sentence or clause, can't always carry the load and so may produce an imprecise statement.

`Thrust.` This showy noun, suggestive of power, hinting of sex, is the darling of  executives, politicos, and speechwriters. Use it sparingly. Save it for specific application.

`Tortuous. Torturous.` A winding road is `tortuous`, a painful ordeal is `torturous`. Both words carry the idea of "twist," the twist having been a form of torture.

`Transpire.` Not to be used in the sense of "happen," "come to pass."

`Try.` Takes the infinitive: "try to mend it," not "try and mend it."

`Type.` Not a synonym for `kind of`.

`Unique.` Means "without like or equal." Hence, there can be no degrees of uniqueness.

`Utilize.` Prefer use.

`Verbal.` Sometimes means "word for word" and in this sense may refer to something expressed in writing.

`Very.` Use this word sparingly. Where emphasis is necessary, use words strong in themselves.

`While.` Avoid the indiscriminate use of this word for `and, but,` and `although`. Many writers use it frequently as a substitute for `and` or `but`, either from a mere desire to vary the connective or from doubt about which of the two connectives is more appropriate. In this use it is best replaced by a semicolon.

`-wise.` Not to be used indiscriminately as a pseudosuffix: `taxwise, pricewise, marriagewise, prosewise, saltwater taffywise`. Chiefly useful when it means "in the manner of": `clockwise`. There is not a noun in the language to which `-wise` cannot be added if the spirit moves one to add it. The sober writer will abstain from the use of this wild additive.

`Worth while.` Overworked as a term of vague approval and (with `not`) of disapproval.

`Would.` Commonly used to express habitual or repeated action. But when the idea of habit or repetition is expressed, in such phrases as `onec a year, every day, each Sunday,` the past tense, without `would`, is usually sufficient, and, from its brevity, more emphatic.
