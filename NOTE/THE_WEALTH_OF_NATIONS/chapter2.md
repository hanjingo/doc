# CHAPTER 2. OF THE PRINCIPLE WHICH GIVES OCCASION TO THE DIVISION OF LABOUR

第二章 论造成分工的原由



Give me that which I want, and you shall have this which you want, is the meaning of every such offer;

给我所需，你也得到所需，这就是每项交易的意义；我们正是通过这种方式得到自己所需的绝大部分帮助的；

As it is by treaty, by barter, and by purchase, that we obtain from one another the greater part of those mutual good offices which we stand in need of, so it is this same trucking disposition which originally gives occasion to the division of labour.

我们所需要的帮助大部分是通过契约，交换和买卖而互相取得的，而最初造成劳动分工的也正是这一互相交换的倾向。

the very different genius which appears to distinguish men of different professions, when grown up to maturity, is not upon many ocasions so much the cause, as the effect of the division of labour.

对成年人来说，使人们从事不同职业的不同才能与其说是劳动分工的原因，不如说是劳动分工的结果。
