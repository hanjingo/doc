# CHAPTER 1. OF THE DIVISION OF LABOUR

第一章 论劳动分工



The greatest improvements in the productive powers of labour, and the greater part of the skill, dexterity, and judgment, with which it is anywhere directed, or applied, seem to have been the effects of the division of labour.

社会生产力，人类劳动技能和思维判断力的大幅提高都是劳动分工的结果。

This great increase in the quantity of work, which, in consequence of the division of labour, the same number of people are capable of performing, is owing to three different circumstances：

劳动分工使得同样数量的人们所能完成的工作量大大增加，这要归因于三种情况：

- first, to the increase of dexterity in every particular workman.

  每个工人的熟练程度提高。

- secondly, to the saving of the time which is commonly lost in passing from one species of work to another.

  节约了由一种工作转到另一种工作通常损耗的时间。
  
- lastly, to the invention of a great number of machines which facilitate and abridge labour, and enable one man to do the work of many.
  
  发明了很多的机器，便利和简化了劳动，使一个人能干许多人的活。
