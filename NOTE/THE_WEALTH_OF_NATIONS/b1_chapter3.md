# CHAPTER 3. THAT THE DIVISION OF LABOUR IS LIMITED BY THE EXTENT OF THE MARKET

第三章 论分工受市场范围的限制



As it is the power of exchanging that gives occasion to the division of labour, so the extent of this division must always be limited by the extent of that power, or, in other words, by the extent of the market. When the market is very small, no person can have any encouragement to dedicate himself entirely to one employment, for want of the power to exchange all that surplus part of the produce of his own labour, which is over and above his own consumption, for such parts of the produce of other men's labour as he has occassion for.

交换能力萌生劳动分工，因而分工的程度必然受制于交换能力的大小，也就是分工的程度要受市场大小的限制。市场过于狭小则不能鼓励人们始终专务一业，因为人们不能用剩余物随意交换自己所需。
