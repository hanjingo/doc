# CHAPTER 6. OF THE COMPONENT PART OF THE PRICE OF COMMODITIES

第六章 论商品价格的组成



As soon as stock has accumulated in the hands of particular person, some of them will naturally employ it in setting to work industrious people, whom they will supply with materials and subsistence, in order to make a profit by the sale of their work, or by what their labour adds to the value of the materials.

资本运作的目的是为了能从劳动上获得价值。

In exchanging the complete manufacture either for money, for labour, or for other goods, over and above what may be sufficient to pay the price of the materials, and the wages of the workmen, something must be given for the profits of the undertaker of the work, who hazards his stock in this adventure. The value which the workmen add to the materials, therefore, resolves itself in this case into two parts, of which the one pays their wages, the other the profits of their employer upon the whole stock of materials and wages which he advanced.

用制造品交换货币，劳动或其它货物时，除支付原材料和劳动者的工资外，必然还须留出投入资本所获得的利润。所以，劳动者对原材料的增值应分为两部分：一部分为劳动者的工资，另一部分为雇主的利润。

Whoever derives his revenue from a fund which is his own, must draw it either from his labour, from his stock, or from his land. The revenue derived from labour is called wages; that derived from stock, by the person who manages or employs it, is called profit; that derived from it by the person who does not employ it himself, but lends it to another, is called the interest or the use of money.

无论任何人，其收入一定来自其资源，如劳动，资本或土地等。如果其收入来自劳动，则称为工资；来自管理或资本运用，则称为利润；如果来自其转借给他人的闲置资本所产生的收入，则称为利息。
