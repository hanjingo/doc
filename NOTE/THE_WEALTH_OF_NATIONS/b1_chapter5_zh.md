# CHAPTER 5. OF THE REAL AND NOMINAL PRICE OF COMMODITIES, OR OF THEIR PRICE IN LABOUR, AND THEIR PRICE IN MONEY

第五章 论商品的真实价格与名义价格，即用劳动表示的商品价格与用货币表示的商品价格



The value of any commodity, therefore, to the person who possesses it, and who means not to use or consume it himself, but to exchange it for other commodities, is equal to the quantity of labour which it enables him to purchase or command. Labour therefore, is the real measure of the exchangeable value of all commodities.

任何商品的价值等同于其占有者能购买或能支配的劳动量。劳动是衡量一切商品交换价值的真实尺度。

Labour alone, therefore, never varying in its own value, is along the ultimate and real standard by which the value of all commodities can at all times and places be estimated and compared. It is their real price; money is their nominal price on

劳动本身的价值恒定不变，因而可作为任何时间，任何地点用以估量和比较各种商品价值的最终真实标准。劳动是商品的真实价格，货币只是商品的名义价格。

Labour, therefore, it appears evidently, is the only universal, as well sa the only accurate, measure of value, or the only standard by which we can compare the values of different commodities, at all times, and at all places.

只有劳动才是衡量真实价值的唯一尺度，即劳动能在任何时间和任何地点比较不同商品的价值。
