# CHAPTER 4. OF THE ORIGIN AND USE OF MONY

第四章 论货币的起源和作用



When the division of labour has been once thoroughly established, it is but a very small part of a man's wants which the produce of his own labour can supply. He supplies the far greater part of them by exchangig that surplus part of the produce of his own labour, which is over and above his own consumption, for such parts of the produce of other men's labour as he has occasion for.

社会分工一经确立，个人的劳动生产物便只能满足自己需求的极小部分，其它部分的需求须用自己的剩余劳动生产物与他人交换获取。

The word VALUE, it is to be observed, has two different meanings, and sometimes expresses the utility of some particular object, and sometimes the power of purchasing other goods which the possession of that object conveys. The one may be called 'value in use'; the other, 'value in exchange'. The things which have the greatest value in use have frequently little or no value in exchange; and, on the contrary, those which have the greatest value in exchange have frequently little or no value in use.

货物之间进行交换所遵循的法则决定了商品的相对价值合交换价值。不过，这两种价值的意义不同，它有时表示特定物品的效用，即使用价值；有时又表示由于占有某物而获得对他种货物的购买力，即交换价值。使用价值大的物品，其交换价值往往很小，甚至没有；同样，交换价值大的物品，其使用价值往往极小。
