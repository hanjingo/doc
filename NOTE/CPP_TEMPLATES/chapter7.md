## 7.1 "Class Template" or "Template Class"?

There is some confusion about how a class that is a template is called:

- The term class template states that the class is a template. That is, it is a parameterized description of a family of classes.
- The term template class on the other hand has been used
    + as a synonym for class template.
    + to refer to classes generated from templates.
    + to refer to classes with a name that is a template-id.
