# Chapter 23 MEASURING THE COST OF LIVING



`consumer price index (CPI)`. a measure of the overall cost of the goods and services bought by a typical consumer.

`inflation rate`. the percentage change in the price index from the preceding period; the inflation rate between two consecutive years is computed as follows:
$$
Inflation\ rate\ in\ year2 = \frac{CPI\ in\ year2 - CPI\ in\ year1}{CPI\ in\ year1} \times 100.
$$
`producer price index`. a measure of the cost of a basket of goods and services bought by firms.

`indexation`. the automatic correction of a dollar amount for the effects of inflation by law or contract.

`nominal interest rate`. the interest rate as usually reported without a correction for the effects of inflation.

`real interest rate`. the interest rate corrected for the effects of inflation.

The relationship among the nominal interest rate, the real interest rate, and inflation as follows:
$$
Real\ interest\ rate = Nominal\ interest\ rate - Inflation\ rate.
$$
