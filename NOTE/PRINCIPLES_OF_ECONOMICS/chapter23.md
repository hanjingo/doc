# Chapter 23 MEASURING THE COST OF LIVING



`consumer price index (CPI)`. a measure of the overall cost of the goods and services bought by a typical consumer.

`inflation rate`. the percentage change in the price index from the preceding period; the inflation rate between two consecutive years is computed as follows:
$$
Inflation\ rate\ in\ year2 = \frac{CPI\ in\ year2 - CPI\ in\ year1}{CPI\ in\ year1} \times 100.
$$
`producer price index`. a measure of the cost of a basket of goods and services bought by firms.

`indexation`. the automatic correction of a dollar amount for the effects of inflation by law or contract.

`nominal interest rate`. the interest rate as usually reported without a correction for the effects of inflation.

`real interest rate`. the interest rate corrected for the effects of inflation.

The relationship among the nominal interest rate, the real interest rate, and inflation as follows:
$$
Real\ interest\ rate = Nominal\ interest\ rate - Inflation\ rate.
$$



## Summary

- The consumer price index shows the cost of a basket of goods and services relative to the cost of the same basket in the base year. The index is used to measure the overall level of prices in the economy. The percentage change in the consuemr pricec index measures the inflation rate.
- The consumer price index is an imperfect measure of the cost of living for three reasons. First, it does not take into account consumers' ability to substitute toward goods that become relatively cheaper over time. Second, it does not take into account increases in the purchasing power of the dollar due to the introduction of new goods. Third, it is distorted by unmeasured changes in the quality of goods and dervices. Because of these measurement problems, the CPI overstates annual inflation by about 1 percentage point.
- Although the GDP deflator also measures the overall level of prices in the economy, it differs from the consumer price index because it includes goods and services produced rather than goods and services consumed. As a result, imported goods affect the consumer price index but not the GDP deflator. In addition, whereas the consumer price index uses a fixed basket of goods, the GDP deflator automatically changes the group of goods and services over time as the composition of GDP changes.
- Dollar figures from different points in time do not represent a valid comparison of purchasing power. To compare a dollar figure from the past to a dollar figure today, the older figure should be inflated using a price index.
- Various laws and private contracts use price indexes to correct for the effects of inflation. The tax laws, however, are only partially indexed for inflation.
- A correction for inflation is especially important when looking at data on interest rates. The nominal interest rate is the interest rate usually reported; it is the rate at which the number of dollars in a savings account increases over time. By contrast, the real interest rate takes into account changes in the value of the dollar over time. The real interest rate equals the nominal interest rate minus the rate of inflation.
