# CHAPTER 22 MEASURING A NATIONâ€™S INCOME



`microeconomics`. the study of how households and firms make decisions and how they interact in markets.

`macroeconomics`. the study of economy-wide phenomena, including inflation, unemployment, and economic growth.

`gross domestic product(GDP)`. the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time.

GDP (which we denote as $Y$) is divided into four components: consumption ($C$), investment ($I$), government purchases ($G$), and net exports ($NX$):
$$
Y = C + I + G + NX
$$
`consumption`. spending by households on goods and services, with the exception of purchases of new housing.

`investment`. spending on capital equipment, inventories, and structures, including household purchases of new housing.

`government purchases`. spending on goods and services by local, state, and federal governments.

`net exports`. spending on odmestically produced goods by foreigners (exports) minus spending on foreign goods by domestic residents (imports).

`nominal GDP`. the production of goods and services valued at current prices.

`real GDP`. the production of goods and services valued at constant prices.

Nominal GDP uses current prices to place a value on the economy's production of goods and services. Real GDP uses constant base-year prices to place a value on the economy's production of goods and services.

`GDP deflator`. a measure of the price level calculated as the ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP times 100; The GDP deflator is calculated as follows:
$$
GDP\ deflator = \frac{Nominal\ GDP}{Real\ GDP} \times 100.
$$



## Summary

- Because every transaction has a buyer and a seller, the total expenditure in the economy must equal the totl income in the economy.
- Gross domestic product (GDP) measures an economy's total expenditure on newly produced goods and services and the total income earned from the production of these goods and services. More precisely, GDP is the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time.
- GDP is divided among four components of expenditure: consumption, investment, government purchases, and net exports. Consumption includes spending on goods and services by households, with the exception of purchases of new housing. Investment includes spending on new equipment and structures, including households' purchases of new housing. Government purchases include spending on goods and services by local, state, and federal governments. Net exports equal the value of goods and services produced domestically and sold abroad (exports) minus the value of goods and services produced abroad and sold domestically (imports).
- Nominal GDP uses current prices to value the economy's production of goods and services. Real GDP uses constant base-year prices to value the economy's production of goods and services. The GDP deflator calculated from the ratio of nominal to real GDP measures the level of prices in the economy.
- GDP is a good measure of economic well-being because people prefer higher to lower incomes. But it  is not a perfect measure of well-being. For example, GDP excludes the value of leisure and the value of a clean environment.
