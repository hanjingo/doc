`gross domestic product(GDP)`. the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time.

GDP (which we denote as $Y$) is divided into four components: consumption ($C$), investment ($I$), government purchases ($G$), and net exports ($NX$):
$$
Y = C + I + G + NX
$$
`consumption`. spending by households on goods and services, with the exception of purchases of new housing.

`investment`. spending on capital equipment, inventories, and structures, including household purchases of new housing.

`government purchases`. spending on goods and services by local, state, and federal governments.

`net exports`. spending on odmestically produced goods by foreigners (exports) minus spending on foreign goods by domestic residents (imports).

`nominal GDP`. the production of goods and services valued at current prices.

`real GDP`. the production of goods and services valued at constant prices.

Nominal GDP uses current prices to place a value on the economy's production of goods and services. Real GDP uses constant base-year prices to place a value on the economy's production of goods and services.

`GDP deflator`. a measure of the price level calculated as the ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP times 100; The GDP deflator is calculated as follows:
$$
GDP\ deflator = \frac{Nominal\ GDP}{Real\ GDP} \times 100.
$$
