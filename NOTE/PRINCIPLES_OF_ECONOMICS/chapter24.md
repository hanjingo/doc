# CHAPTER 4 PRODUCTION AND GROWTH



`productivity`. the amount of goods and services produced from each hour of a worker's time.

`physical capital`. the stock of equipment and structures that are used to produce goods and services.

`human capital`. the knowledge and skills that workers acquire through education, training, and experience.

`natural resources`. the inputs into the production of goods and services that are provided by nature, such as land, rivers, and mineral deposits.

`technological knowledge`. society's understanding of the best ways to produce goods and services.

Economists often use a production function to describe the relationship between the quantity of inputs used in production and the quantity of output from production. suppose $Y$ denotes the quantity of output, $L$ the quantity of labor, $K$ the quantity of physical capital, $H$ the quantity of human capital, and $N$ the quantity of natural resources. Then we might write:
$$
Y = AF(L, K, H, N)
$$
where $F()$ is a function that shows how the inputs are combined to produce output. $A$ is a variable that reflects the available production technology. As technology improves, $A$ rises, so the economy produces more output from any given combination of inputs.

`diminishing returns`. the property whereby the benefit from an extra unit of an input declines as the quantity of the input increases.

`catch-up effect`. The property whereby countries that start off poor tend to grow more rapidly than countries that start off rich.

In the long run, the higher saving rate leads to a higher level of productivity and income, but not to higher growth in these variables.



## Summary

- Economic prosperity, as measured by GDP per person, varies substantially around the world. The average income in the world's richest countries in more than ten times that in the world's poorest countries. Because growth rates of real GDP also vary substantially, the relative positions of countries can change dramatically over time.
- The standard of living in an economy depends on the economy's ability to produce goods and services. Productivity, in turn, depends on the amounts of physical capital, human capital, natural resources, and technological knowledge available to workers.
- Government policies can influence the economy's growth rate in many ways: encouraging saving and investment, encouraging investment from abroad, fostering education, maintaining property rights and political stability, allowing free trade, controlling population growth, and promoting the research an development of new technologies.
- The accumulation of capital is subject to diminishing returns: The more capital an economy has, the less additional output the economy gets from an extra unit of capital. Because of diminishing returns, higher saving leads to higher growth for a period of time, but growth eventually slows down as the economy approaches a higher level of capital, productivity, and income. Also because of diminishing returns, the return to capital is especially high in poor countries. Other things equal, these countries can grow faster because of the catch-up effect.
