# CHAPTER 4 PRODUCTION AND GROWTH



`productivity`. the amount of goods and service produced from each hour of a worker's time.

`physical capital`. the stock of equipment and structures that are used to produce goods and services.

`human capital`. the knowledge and skills that workers acquire through education, training, and experience.

`natural resources`. the inputs into the production of goods and services that are provided by nature, such as land, rivers, and minerla deposits.

`technological knowledge`. society's understanding of the best ways to produce goods and services.

Economists often use a production function to describe the relationship between the quantity of inputs used in production and the quantity of output from production. suppose $Y$ denotes the quantity of output, $L$ the quantity of labor, $K$ the quantity of physical capital, $H$ the quantity of human capital, and $N$ the quantity of natural resources. Then we might write:
$$
Y = AF(L, K, H, N)
$$
where $F()$ is a function that shows how the inputs are combined to produce output. $A$ is a variable that reflects the available production technology. As technology improves, $A$ rises, so the economy produces more output from any given combination of inputs.

`diminishing returns`. the property whereby the benefit from an extra unit of an input declines as the quantity of the input increases.

`catch-up effect`. the property whereby countries that start off poor tend to grow more rapidly than countries that start off rich.

In the long run, the higher saving rate leads to a highr level of productivity and income, but not to higher growth in these variables.
