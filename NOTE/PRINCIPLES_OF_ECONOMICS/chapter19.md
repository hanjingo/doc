# CHAPTER 19 EARNINGS AND DISCRIMINATION



`compensating differential`. a difference in wages that arises to offset the nonmonetary characteristics of different jobs.

`human capital`. the accumulation of investments in people, such as education and on-the-job training.

Superstars arise in markets that have two characteristics:

- Every customer in the market want to enjoy the good supplied by the best producer.
- The good is produced with a technology that make it possible for the best producer to supply every customer at low cost.

`union`. a worker association that bargains with employers over wages and workding conditions.

`strike`. the organized withdrawal of labor from a firm by a union.

`efficiency wages`. above-equilibrium wages paid by firm in order to increase worker productivity.

`discrimination`. the offering of different opportunities to similar individuals who differ only by race, ethnic group, sex, age, or other personal characteristics.

Because the differences in average wages among groups in part reflect differences in human capital and job characteristics, they do not by themselves say anything about how much discrimination there is in the labor market.

`comparable worth`. a doctrine according to which jobs deemed comparable should be paid the same wage.
