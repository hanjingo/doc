# CHAPTER 11 PUBLIC GOODS AND COMMON RESOURCES



`excludability`. the property of a good whereby a person can be prevented from using it.

`rivalry`. the property of a good whereby one person's use diminishes other people's use.

In thinking about the various goods in the economy, it is useful to group them according to two characteristics:

- Is the good excludable? Can people be prevented from using the  good?
- Is the good rival? Does one person's use of the good diminish another person's enjoyment of it?

Using these two characteristics, Figure 11-1 divides goods into four categories:

1. `Private goods` are both excludable and rival.
2. `Public goods` are neither excludable nor rival.
3. `Common resources` are rival but not excludable.
4. When a good is excludable but not rival, it is an example of a `natural monopoly`.

`free rider`. a person who receives the benefit of a good but avoids paying for it.

`cost-benefit analysis`. a study that compares the costs and benefits to society of providing a public good.

`Tragedy of the Commons`. a parable that illustrates why common resources get used more than is desirable from the standpoint of society as a whole.
