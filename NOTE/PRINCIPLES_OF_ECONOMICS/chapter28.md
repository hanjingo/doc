# CHAPTER28 MONEY GROWTH AND INFLATION



In the long run, the overall level of prices adjusts to the level at which the demand for money equals the supply.

`quantity theory of money`. a theory asserting that the quantity of money available determines the price level and that the growth rate in the quantity of money available determines the inflation rate.

`nominal variables`. variables measured in monetary units.

`real variables`. variables measured in physical units.

`classical dichotomy`. the theoretical separation of nominal and rel variables.

`monetary neutrality`. the proposition that changes in the money supply do not affect real variables.

`velocity of money`. the rate at which money change hands.

if $P$ is the price level (the GDP deflator), $Y$ the quantity of output (real GDP), and $M$ the quantity of money, then velocity is 
$$
V = (P \times Y) / M
$$
`quantity equation`. the equation $M \times V = P \times Y$, which relates the quantity of money, the velocity of money, and the dollar value of the economy's output of goods and services.

`inflation tax`. the revenue the government raises by creating money.

`Fisher effect`. the one-for-one adjustment of the nominal interest rate to the inflation rate.

`hsoeleather costs`. the resources wasted when inflation encourages people to reduce their money holdings.

`menu costs`. the costs of changing prices.
