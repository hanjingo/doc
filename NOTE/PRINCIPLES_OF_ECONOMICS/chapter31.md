# CHAPTER 31 AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY



`recession`. a period of declining real incomes and rising unemployment.

`depression`. a severe recession.

`model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply`. the model that most economists use to explain short-run fluctuations in economic activity around its long-run trend.

`aggregate-demand curve`. a curve that shows the quantity of goods and services that households, firms and the government want to buy at each price level.

`aggregate-supply curve`. a curve that shows the quantity of goods and services that firms choose to produce and sell at each price level.

Thus, a decrease in the price level makes consumers feel more wealthy, which in turn encourages them to spend more. The increase in consumer spending means a larger quantity of goods and services demanded.

Thus, when a fall in the U.S. price level causes U.S. interest rates to fall, the real exchange rate depreciates, and this depreciation stimulates U.S. net exports and thereby increases the quantity of goods and services demanded.

In the long run, the aggregate-supply curve is vertical, whereas in the short run, the aggregate-supply curve is upward sloping.

In the long run, an economy's production of goods and services (its real GDP) depends on its supplies of labor, capital, and natural resources and on the available technology used to turn these factors of production into goods and services.

Short-run fluctuations in output and the price level should be viewed as deviations from the continuing long-run trends.

A lower price level causes misperceptions about relative prices, and these misperceptions induce suppliers to respond to the lower price level by decreasing the quantity of goods and services supplied.

Because wages do not adjust immediately to the price level, a lower price level makes employment and production less profitable, which induces firms to reduce the quantity of goods and services supplied.

Because not all prices adjust instantly to changing conditions, an unexpected fall in the price level leaves some firms with higher-than-desired prices, and these higher-than-desired prices depress sales and induce firms to reduce the quantity of goods and services they produce.

An increase in the expected price level reduces the quantity of goods and services supplied and shifts the short-run aggregate-supply curve to the left. A decrease in the expected price level raises the quantity of goods and services supplied and shifts the short-run aggregate-supply curve to the right.

`stagflation`. a period of falling output and rising prices.
