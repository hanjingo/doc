# CHAPTER 33 THE SHOR T-RUN TRADEOFF BETWEEN INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT



`Phillips curve`. a curve that shows the short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.

The Phillips curve simply shows the combinations of inflation and unemployment that arise in the short run as shifts in the aggregate-demand curve move the economy along the short-run aggregate-supply curve.

`natural-rate hypothesis`. the claim that unemployment eventually returns to its normal, or natural, rate, regardless of the rate of inflation.

`supply shock`. an event that directly alters firms' costs and prices, shifting the economy's aggregate-supply curve and thus the Phillips curve.

`sacrifice ratio`. the number of percentage points of annual output lost in the process of reducing inflation by 1 percentage point.

`rational expectations`. the theory according to which people optimally use all the information they have, including information about government policies, when forecasting the future.



## Summary

- The Phillips curve describes a negative relationship between inflation and unemployment. By expanding aggregate demand, policymakers can choose a point on the Phillips curve with higher inflation and lower unemployment. By contracting aggregate demand, policymakers can choose a point on the Phillips curve with lower inflation and higher unemployment.
- The tradeoff between inflation and unemployment described by the Phillips curve holds only in the short run. In the long run, expected inflation adjusts to changes in actual inflation, and the short-run Phillips curve shifts. As a result, the long-run Phillips curve is vertical at the natural rate of unemployment.
- The short-run Phillips curve also shifts because of shocks to aggregate supply. An adverse supply shock, such as the increase in world oil prices during the 1970s, gives policymakers a less favorable tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. That is, after an adverse supply shock, policymakers have to accept a higher rate of inflation for any given rate of unemployment, or a higher rate of unemployment for any given rate of inflation.
- When the Fed contracts growth in the money supply to reduce inflation, it moves the economy along the shortrun Phillips curve, which results in temporarily high unemployment. The cost of disinflation depends on how quickly expectations of inflation fall. Some economists argue that a credible commitment to low inflation can reduce the cost of disinflation by inducing a quick adjustment of expectations.
