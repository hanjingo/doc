# CHAPTER 33 THE SHOR T-RUN TRADEOFF BETWEEN INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT



`Phillips curve`. a curve that shows the short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.

The Phillips curve simply shows the combinations of inflation and unemployment that arise in the short run as shifts in the aggregate-demand curve move the economy along the short-run aggregate-supply curve.

`natural-rate hypothesis`. the claim that unemployment eventually returns to its normal, or natural, rate, regardless of the rate of inflation.

`supply shock`. an event that directly alters firms' costs and prices, shifting the economy's aggregate-supply curve and thus the Phillips curve.

`sacrifice ratio`. the number of percentage points of annual output lost in the process of reducing inflation by 1 percentage point.

`rational expectations`. the theory according to which people optimally use all the information they have, including information about government policies, when forecasting the future.
