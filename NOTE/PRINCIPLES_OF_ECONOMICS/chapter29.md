# CHAPTER 29 OPEN-ECONOMY MACROECONOMICS: BASIC CONCEPTS



`closed economy`. an economy that does not interact with other economies in the world.

`open economy`. an economy that interacts freely with other economies around the world.

`exports`. goods and services that are produced domestically and sold abroad.

`net exports`. the value of a nation's exports minus the value of its imports, also called the trade balance.

`trade balance`. the value of a nation's exports minus the value of its imports, also called net exports.

`trade surplus`. an excess of exports over imports.

`trade deficit`. an excess of imports over exports.

`balanced trade`. a situation in which exports equal imports.

`net foreign investment`. the purchase of foreign assets by domestic residents minust the purchase of domestic assets by foreignres.

Here, let's consider briefly some of the more important variables that influence net foreign investment:

- The real interest rates being paid on foreign assets.
- The real interest rates being paid on domestic assets.
- The perceived economic and political risks of holding assets abroad.
- The government policies that affect foreign ownership of domestic assets.

An important but subtile fact of accounting states that, for an economy as a whole, these two imbalances must offset each other. That is, net foreign investment $(NFI)$ always equals net exports $(NX)$:
$$
NFI = NX.
$$
This equation holds because every transaction that affects one side of this equation must also affect the other side by exactly the same amount.

The economy's gross domestic product $(Y)$ is divided among four components: consumption $(C)$, investament $(I)$, government purchases $(G)$, and net export $(NX)$. We write this as:
$$
Y = C + I + G + NX
$$
National saving $(S)$ equals $Y - C - G$. If we rearrange the above equation to reflect this fact, we obtain:
$$
\begin{equation}\begin{split}
Y - C - G &= I + NX \\
S &= I + NX 
\end{split}\end{equation}
$$
Because net exports$(NX)$ also equal net foreign investment $(NFI)$, we can write this equation as:
$$
S = I + NFI \\
Saving = Domestic\ investment + Net\ foreign\ investment.
$$
`nominal exchange rate`. the rate at which a person can trade the currency of one country for the currency of another.

`appreciation`. an increase in the value of a currency as measured by the amount of foreign currency it can buy.

`depreciation`. a decrease in the value of a currency as measured by the amount of foreign currency it can buy.

`real exchange rate`. the rate at which a person can trade the goods and services of one country for the goods and services of another.

We can summarize this calculation for the real exchange rate with the following formulat:
$$
Real\ exchange\ rate = \frac{Nominal\ exchange\ rate \times Domestic\ price}{Foreign\ price}
$$
`purchasing-power parity`. a theory of exchange rates whereby a unit of any given currency should be able to buy the same quantity of goods in all countries.



## Summary

- Net exports are the value of domestic goods and services sold abroad minus the value of foreign goods and services sold domestically. Net foreign investment is the acquisition of foreign assets by domestic residents minus the acquisition of domestic assets by foreigners. Because every international transaction involves an exchange of an asset for a good or service, an economy’s net foreign investment always equals its net exports.
- An economy’s saving can be used either to finance investment at home or to buy assets abroad. Thus, national saving equals domestic investment plus net foreign investment.
- The nominal exchange rate is the relative price of the currency of two countries, and the real exchange rate is the relative price of the goods and services of two countries. When the nominal exchange rate changes so that each dollar buys more foreign currency, the dollar is said to appreciate or strengthen. When the nominal exchange rate changes so that each dollar buys less foreign currency, the dollar is said to depreciate or weaken.
- According to the theory of purchasing-power parity, a dollar (or a unit of any other currency) should be able to buy the same quantity of goods in all countries. This theory implies that the nominal exchange rate between the currencies of two countries should reflect the price levels in those countries. As a result, countries with relatively high inflation should have depreciating currencies, and countries with relatively low inflation should have appreciating currencies.
