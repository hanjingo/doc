# CHAPTER 17 MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION



`monopolistic competition`. a market structure in which many firms sell products that are similar but not identical.

Monopolistic competition describes a market with the following attributes:

- Many sellers: There are many firms competing for the same group of customers.
- Product differentiation: Each firm produces a product that is at least slightly different from those of other firms. Thus, rather than being a price taker, each firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve.
- Free entry: Firms can enter (or exit) the market without restriction. Thus, the number of firms in the market adjusts until economic profits are driven to zero.

To sum up, two characteristics describe the long-run equilibrium in a monopolistically competitive market:

- As in a monopoly market, price exceeds marginal cost. This conclusion arises because profit maximization requires marginal revenue to equal marginal cost and because the downward sloping demand curve makes marginal revenue less than the price.
- As in a competitive market, price equals average total cost. This conclusion arises because free entry and exit drive economic profit to zero.

Whenever a new firm considers entering the market with a new product, it considers only the profit it would make. Yet its entry would also have two external effects:

- `The product-variety externality`: Because consumers get some consumer surplus from the introduction of a new product, entry of a new firm conveys an positive externality on consumers.
- The business-stealing externality: Because other firms lose customers and profits from the entry of a new competitor, entry of a new firm imposes a negative externality on existing firms.
