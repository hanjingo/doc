# CHAPTER 26 UNEMPLOYMENT  AND ITS NATURAL RATE



`labor force`. the total number of workers, including both the employed and the unemployed.

The BLS defines the labor force as the sum of the employed and the unemployed:
$$
Labor\ force = Number\ employed + number\ of\ unemployed
$$
`unemployment rate`. the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed.

The BLS defines the unemployment rate as the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed:
$$
Unemployment\ rate = \frac{Number\ of\ unemployed}{Labor\ force} \times 100.
$$

`labor-force participation rate`. the percentage of the addult population that is in the labor force.

The BLS uses the same survey to produce data on labor-force participation. The labor-force participation rate measures the percentage of the total adult population of the United States that is in the labor force:
$$
Labor-force\ participation\ rate = \frac{Labor\ force}{Adult\ population} \times 100.
$$
`natural rate of unemployment`. the normal rate of unemployment around which the unemployment rate fluctuates.

`cyclical unemployment`. the deviation of unemployment from its natural rate.

`discouraged workers`. individuals who would like to work but have given up looking for a job.

Most spells of unemployment are short, and most unemployment observed at any given time is long-term.

`frictional unemployment`. unemployment that results because it takes time for workers to search for the jobs that best suit their tastes and skills.

`structural unemployment`. unemployment that results because. the number of jobs available in some labor markets is insufficient to provide a job for everyone who want one.

`job search`. the process by which workers find appropriate jobs given their tastes and skills.

`unemployment insurance`. a government program that partially protects workers' incomes when they become unemployed.

If the wage is kept above the equilibrium level for any reason, the result is unemployment.

`union`. a worker association that bargains with employers over wages and working conditions.

`collective bargaining`. the process by which unions and firms agree on the terms of employment.

`strike`. the organized withdrawal of labor from a firm by a union.

`efficiency wages`. above-equilibrium wages paid by firms in order to increase worker productivity.
