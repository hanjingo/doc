# CHAPTER 26 UNEMPLOYMENT  AND ITS NATURAL RATE



`labor force`. the total number of workers, including both the employed and the unemployed.

The BLS defines the labor force as the sum of the employed and the unemployed:
$$
Labor\ force = Number\ employed + number\ of\ unemployed
$$
`unemployment rate`. the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed.

The BLS defines the unemployment rate as the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed:
$$
Unemployment\ rate = \frac{Number\ of\ unemployed}{Labor\ force} \times 100.
$$

`labor-force participation rate`. the percentage of the addult population that is in the labor force.

The BLS uses the same survey to produce data on labor-force participation. The labor-force participation rate measures the percentage of the total adult population of the United States that is in the labor force:
$$
Labor-force\ participation\ rate = \frac{Labor\ force}{Adult\ population} \times 100.
$$
`natural rate of unemployment`. the normal rate of unemployment around which the unemployment rate fluctuates.

`cyclical unemployment`. the deviation of unemployment from its natural rate.

`discouraged workers`. individuals who would like to work but have given up looking for a job.

Most spells of unemployment are short, and most unemployment observed at any given time is long-term.

`frictional unemployment`. unemployment that results because it takes time for workers to search for the jobs that best suit their tastes and skills.

`structural unemployment`. unemployment that results because. the number of jobs available in some labor markets is insufficient to provide a job for everyone who want one.

`job search`. the process by which workers find appropriate jobs given their tastes and skills.

`unemployment insurance`. a government program that partially protects workers' incomes when they become unemployed.

If the wage is kept above the equilibrium level for any reason, the result is unemployment.

`union`. a worker association that bargains with employers over wages and working conditions.

`collective bargaining`. the process by which unions and firms agree on the terms of employment.

`strike`. the organized withdrawal of labor from a firm by a union.

`efficiency wages`. above-equilibrium wages paid by firms in order to increase worker productivity.



## Summary

- The unemployment rate is the percentage of those who would like to work who do not have jobs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates this statistic monthly based on a survey of thousands of households.
- The unemployment rate is an imperfect measure of joblessness. Some people who call themselves unemployed may actually not want to work, and some people who would like to work have left the labor force after an unsuccessful search.
- In the U.S. economy, most people who become unemployed find work within a short period of time. Nonetheless, most unemployment observed at any given time is attributable to the few people who are unemployed for long periods of time.
- One reason for unemployment is the time it takes for workers to search for jobs that best suit their tastes and skills. Unemployment insurance is a government policy that, while protecting workers' incomes, increases the amount of frictional unemployment.
- A second reason why our economy always has some unemployment is minimum-wage laws. By raising the wage of unskilled and experienced workers above the equilibrium level, minimum-wage laws raise the quantity of labor supplied and reduce the quantity demanded. The resulting surplus of labor represents unemployment.
- A third reason for unemployment is the market power of unions. When unions push the wages in unionized industries above the equilibrium level, they create a surplus of labor.
- A fourth reason for unemployment is suggested by the theory of efficiency wages. According to this theory, firms find it profitable to pay wages above the equilibrium level. High wages can improve worker health, lower worker turnover, increase worker effort, and raise worker quality.
