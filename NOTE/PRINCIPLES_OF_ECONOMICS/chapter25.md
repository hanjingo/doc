# CHAPTER 25 S A VING, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM



`financial system`. the group of institutions in the economy that help to match one person's saving with another person's investment.

`financial markets`. financial institutions through which savers can directly provide funds to borrowers.

`bond`. a certificate of indebtedness.

`stock`. a claim to partial ownership in a firm.

`financial intermediaries`. financial institutions through which savers can indirectly provide funds to borrowers.

`mutual fund`. an institution that sells shares to the public an duses the proceeds to buy a portfolio of stocks and bonds.

Recall that gross domestic product (GDP) is both total income in an economy and the total expenditure on the economy's output of goods and services. GDP (denoted as $Y$) is divided into four components of expenditure: consumption($C$), investment($I$), government purchases($G$), and net exports($NX$). We write:
$$
Y = C + I + G + NX
$$
This equation is an identity because every dollar of expenditure that shows up on the left-hand side also shows up in one of the four components on the right-hand side.

`national saving (saving)`. the total income in the economy that remains after paying for consumption and government purchases. Denote national saving($S$), investment($I$):
$$
S = I
$$
`private saving`. the income that households have left after paying for taxes and consuption.

`public saving`. the tax revenue that the government has left after paying for its spending.

`budget surplus`. an excess of tax revenue over government spending.

`budget deficit`. a shortfall of tax revenue from government spending.

`market for loanable funds`. the market in which those who want to save supply  funds and those who want to borrow to invest demand funds.

For the economy as a whole, saving must be equal to investment.

if a change in the tax laws encouraged greater saving, the result would be lower interest rates and greater investment.

if a change in the tax laws encouraged greater investment, the result would be higher interest rates and greater saving.

`crowding out`. a decrease in investment that results from government borrowing.

When the government reduces national saving by running a budget deficit, the interest rate rises, and investment falls.

A budget surplus increases the supply of loanable funds, reduces the interest rate, and stimulates investment.
