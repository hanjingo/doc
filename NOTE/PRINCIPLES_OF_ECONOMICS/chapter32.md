# CHAPTER 32 THE INFLUENCE OF MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY O N AGGREGA TE DEMAND



The aggregate-demand curve slopes downward for three reasons:

- The wealth effect: A lower price level raises the real value of households' money holdings, and higher real wealth stimulates consumer spending.
- The interest-rate effect: A lower price level lowers the interest rate as people try to lend out their excess money holdings, and the lower interest rate stimulates investment spending.
- The exchange-rate effect: When a lower price level lowers the interest rate, investors move some of their funds overseas and cause the domestic currency to depreciate relative to foreign currencies. This depreciation makes domestic goods cheaper compared to foreign goods and, therefore, stimulates spending on net exports.

`theory of liquidity preference`. Keynes's theory that the interest rate adjusts to bring money supply and money demand into balance.

For the U.S. economy, the most important reason for the downward slope of the aggregate-demand curve is the interest-rate effect.

When the Fed increases the money supply, it lowers the interest rate and increases the quantity of goods and services demanded for any given price level, shifting the aggregate-demand curve to the right. Conversely, when the Fed contracts the money supply, it raises the interest rate and reduces the quantity of goods and services demanded for any given price level, shifting the aggregate-demand curve to the left.

Monetary policy can be described either in terms of the money supply or in terms of the interest rate.

`multiplier effect`. the additional shifts in aggregate demand that result when expansionary fiscal policy increases income and thereby increases consumer spending.

`crowding-out effect` the offset in aggregate demand that results when expansionary fiscal policy raises the interest rate and thereby reduces investment spending.

When the government increases its purchases by `$`20 billion, the aggregate demand for goods and services could rise by more or less than `$`20 billion, depending on whether the multiplier effect or the crowding-out effect is larger.

`automatic stabilizers`. changes in fiscal policy that stimulate aggregate demand when the economy goes into a recession without policymakers having to take any deliberate action.
