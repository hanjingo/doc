# CHAPTER 32 THE INFLUENCE OF MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY O N AGGREGA TE DEMAND



The aggregate-demand curve slopes downward for three reasons:

- The wealth effect: A lower price level raises the real value of households' money holdings, and higher real wealth stimulates consumer spending.
- The interest-rate effect: A lower price level lowers the interest rate as people try to lend out their excess money holdings, and the lower interest rate stimulates investment spending.
- The exchange-rate effect: When a lower price level lowers the interest rate, investors move some of their funds overseas and cause the domestic currency to depreciate relative to foreign currencies. This depreciation makes domestic goods cheaper compared to foreign goods and, therefore, stimulates spending on net exports.

`theory of liquidity preference`. Keynes's theory that the interest rate adjusts to bring money supply and money demand into balance.

For the U.S. economy, the most important reason for the downward slope of the aggregate-demand curve is the interest-rate effect.

When the Fed increases the money supply, it lowers the interest rate and increases the quantity of goods and services demanded for any given price level, shifting the aggregate-demand curve to the right. Conversely, when the Fed contracts the money supply, it raises the interest rate and reduces the quantity of goods and services demanded for any given price level, shifting the aggregate-demand curve to the left.

Monetary policy can be described either in terms of the money supply or in terms of the interest rate.

`multiplier effect`. the additional shifts in aggregate demand that result when expansionary fiscal policy increases income and thereby increases consumer spending.

`crowding-out effect` the offset in aggregate demand that results when expansionary fiscal policy raises the interest rate and thereby reduces investment spending.

When the government increases its purchases by `$`20 billion, the aggregate demand for goods and services could rise by more or less than `$`20 billion, depending on whether the multiplier effect or the crowding-out effect is larger.

`automatic stabilizers`. changes in fiscal policy that stimulate aggregate demand when the economy goes into a recession without policymakers having to take any deliberate action.



## Summary

- In developing a theory of short-run economic fluctuations, Keynes proposed the theory of liquidity preference to explain the determinants of the interest rate. According to this theory, the interest rate adjusts to balance the supply and demand for money
- An increase in the price level raises money demand and increases the interest rate that brings the money market into equilibrium. Because the interest rate represents the cost of borrowing, a higher interest rate reduces investment and, thereby, the quantity of goods and services demanded. The downward-sloping aggregatedemand curve expresses this negative relationship between the price level and the quantity demanded.
- Policymakers can influence aggregate demand with monetary policy. An increase in the money supply reduces the equilibrium interest rate for any given price level. Because a lower interest rate stimulates investment spending, the aggregate-demand curve shifts to the right. Conversely, a decrease in the money supply raises the equilibrium interest rate for any given price level and shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the left.
- Policymakers can also influence aggregate demand with fiscal policy. An increase in government purchases or a cut in taxes shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the right. A decrease in government purchases or an increase in taxes shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the left.
- When the government alters spending or taxes, the resulting shift in aggregate demand can be larger or smaller than the fiscal change. The multiplier effect tends to amplify the effects of fiscal policy on aggregate demand. The crowding-out effect tends to dampen the effects of fiscal policy on aggregate demand.
- Because monetary and fiscal policy can influence aggregate demand, the government sometimes uses these policy instruments in an attempt to stabilize the economy. Economists disagree about how active the government should be in this effort. According to advocates of active stabilization policy, changes in attitudes by households and firms shift aggregate demand; if the government does not respond, the result is undesirable and unnecessary fluctuations in output and employment. According to critics of active stabilization policy, monetary and fiscal policy work with such long lags that attempts at stabilizing the economy often end up being destabilizing.
