# CHAPTER 30 A MACROECONOMIC THEORY OF THE OPEN ECONOMY



At the equilibrium interest rate, the amount that people want to save exactly balances the desired quantities of domestic investment and net foreign investment.

At the equilibrium real exchange rate, the demand for dollars by foreigners arising from the U.S. net exports of goods and services exactly balances the supply of dollars from Americans arising from U.S. net foreign investment.

We have been discussing how the economy coordinates four important macroeconomic variables: national saving $(S)$, domestic investment $(I)$, net foreign investment $(NFI)$, and net exports $(NX)$. Keep in mind the following identities:
$$
S = I + NFI
$$
and
$$
NFI = NX
$$
Hence, in an open economy, government budget deficits raise real interest rates, crowd out domestic investment, cause the dollar to appreciate, and push the trade balance toward deficit.

`trade policy`. a government policy that directly influences the quantity of goods and services that a country imports or exports.

`capital flight`. a large and sudden reduction in the demand for assets located in a country.
