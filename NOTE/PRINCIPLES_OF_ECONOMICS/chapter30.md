# CHAPTER 30 A MACROECONOMIC THEORY OF THE OPEN ECONOMY



At the equilibrium interest rate, the amount that people want to save exactly balances the desired quantities of domestic investment and net foreign investment.

At the equilibrium real exchange rate, the demand for dollars by foreigners arising from the U.S. net exports of goods and services exactly balances the supply of dollars from Americans arising from U.S. net foreign investment.

We have been discussing how the economy coordinates four important macroeconomic variables: national saving $(S)$, domestic investment $(I)$, net foreign investment $(NFI)$, and net exports $(NX)$. Keep in mind the following identities:
$$
S = I + NFI
$$
and
$$
NFI = NX
$$
Hence, in an open economy, government budget deficits raise real interest rates, crowd out domestic investment, cause the dollar to appreciate, and push the trade balance toward deficit.

`trade policy`. a government policy that directly influences the quantity of goods and services that a country imports or exports.

`capital flight`. a large and sudden reduction in the demand for assets located in a country.



## Summary

- To analyze the macroeconomics of open economies, two markets are central—the market for loanable funds and the market for foreign-currency exchange. In the market for loanable funds, the interest rate adjusts to balance the supply of loanable funds (from national saving) and the demand for loanable funds (from domestic investment and net foreign investment). In the market for foreign-currency exchange, the real exchange rate adjusts to balance the supply of dollars (for net foreign investment) and the demand for dollars (for net exports). Because net foreign investment is part of the demand for loanable funds and provides the supply of dollars for foreign-currency exchange, it is the variable that connects these two markets.
- A policy that reduces national saving, such as a government budget deficit, reduces the supply of loanable funds and drives up the interest rate. The higher interest rate reduces net foreign investment, which reduces the supply of dollars in the market for foreign-currency exchange. The dollar appreciates, and net exports fall.
- Although restrictive trade policies, such as tariffs or quotas on imports, are sometimes advocated as a way to alter the trade balance, they do not necessarily have that effect. A trade restriction increases net exports for a given exchange rate and, therefore, increases the demand for dollars in the market for foreign-currency exchange. As a result, the dollar appreciates in value, making domestic goods more expensive relative to foreign goods. This appreciation offsets the initial impact of the trade restriction on net exports.
- When investors change their attitudes about holding assets of a country, the ramifications for the country’s economy can be profound. In particular, political instability can lead to capital flight, which tends to increase interest rates and cause the currency to depreciate.
