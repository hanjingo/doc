# 44 Foul Ways to Win an Argument

1. Accuse Your Opponent of Doing What He Is Accusing You of (or worse)

   > When under attack and having trouble defending themselves, manipulators turn the tables. They accuse their opponent of doing what they are being accused of.

2. Accuse Him of Sliding down a Slippery Slope (that leads to disaster)

   > The slippery slope is used when a person implies that if someone does one thing (A), it will inevitably lead to a domino effect of negative things that, in the end will result in something terrible.

3. Appeal to Authority

   > Though power, celebrity, and status rarely correlate in any way with knowledge and insight, people are mesmerized by them.

4. Appeal to Experience

   > Skilled manipulators, con artists, and politicians often imply that they have "experience" to back them up, even when their experiences are limited, or nonexistent. They know it is much harder for someone to deny what they say if they speak with the voice of experience.

5. Appeal to Fear

   > Deep down, most people have a lot of fears. The unprincipled manipulators know that people tend to react primitively when any of these fears are activated.

6. Appeal to Pity(or sympathy)

   > Manipulators know how to portray themselves (and their situation) in such a way as to make people feel sorry for them or at least gain their sympathy, especially when they don't want to take responsibility for something they have done.

7. Appeal to Popular Passions

   > Everyone has some prejudices and most people feel hatred toward something or someone. Masters of spin stir up prejudices, hatred and irrational fears.

8. Appeal to Tradition or Faith("the tried and true")

   > This strategy is closely related to the previous one, but emphasizes what seems to have passed the test of time. People are often enslaved by the social customs and norms of their culture, as well as traditional beliefs. 
   >
   > They imply that their opponent will destroy these traditions and faith. They don't worry about whether these traditions harm innocent people (like the cruel customs and laws against Blacks before the Civil Rights Movement). They create the appearance of being independent in their views while the views they "independently" reach just happen to coincide with those of the crowd. They know that people are usually suspicious of those who go against present social norms and established traditions.

9. Assume a Posture of Righteousness

   > People begin with the deep-seated belief that they (their nation, their religion, their motivation) are especially pure and ethical.
   >
   > Manipulators take advantage of this questionable premise by speaking and writing with such assumptions in the background.

10. Attack the Person

    > When the opponent makes reasonable arguments, manipulators ignore those arguments and instead find a way to personally attack the reasoner.

11. Beg the Question

    > One easy way to prove a point is to assume it in the
