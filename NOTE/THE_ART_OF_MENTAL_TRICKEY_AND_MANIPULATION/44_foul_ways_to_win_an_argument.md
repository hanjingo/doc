# 44 Foul Ways to Win an Argument

1. Accuse Your Opponent of Doing What He Is Accusing You of (or worse)

   > When under attack and having trouble defending themselves, manipulators turn the tables. They accuse their opponent of doing what they are being accused of.

2. Accuse Him of Sliding down a Slippery Slope (that leads to disaster)

   > The slippery slope is used when a person implies that if someone does one thing (A), it will inevitably lead to a domino effect of negative things that, in the end will result in something terrible.

3. Appeal to Authority

   > Though power, celebrity, and status rarely correlate in any way with knowledge and insight, people are mesmerized by them.

4. Appeal to Experience

   > Skilled manipulators, con artists, and politicians often imply that they have "experience" to back them up, even when their experiences are limited, or nonexistent. They know it is much harder for someone to deny what they say if they speak with the voice of experience.

5. Appeal to Fear

   > Deep down, most people have a lot of fears. The unprincipled manipulators know that people tend to react primitively when any of these fears are activated.

6. Appeal to Pity(or sympathy)

   > Manipulators know how to portray themselves (and their situation) in such a way as to make people feel sorry for them or at least gain their sympathy, especially when they don't want to take responsibility for something they have done.

7. Appeal to Popular Passions

   > Everyone has some prejudices and most people feel hatred toward something or someone. Masters of spin stir up prejudices, hatred and irrational fears.

8. Appeal to Tradition or Faith("the tried and true")

   > This strategy is closely related to the previous one, but emphasizes what seems to have passed the test of time. People are often enslaved by the social customs and norms of their culture, as well as traditional beliefs. 
   >
   > They imply that their opponent will destroy these traditions and faith. They don't worry about whether these traditions harm innocent people (like the cruel customs and laws against Blacks before the Civil Rights Movement). They create the appearance of being independent in their views while the views they "independently" reach just happen to coincide with those of the crowd. They know that people are usually suspicious of those who go against present social norms and established traditions.

9. Assume a Posture of Righteousness

   > People begin with the deep-seated belief that they (their nation, their religion, their motivation) are especially pure and ethical.
   >
   > Manipulators take advantage of this questionable premise by speaking and writing with such assumptions in the background.

10. Attack the Person

    > When the opponent makes reasonable arguments, manipulators ignore those arguments and instead find a way to personally attack the reasoner.

11. Beg the Question

    > One easy way to prove a point is to assume it in the first place.

12. Call for Perfection (Demand impossible conditions)

    > You opponent wants you to agree to X, and you realize you can't argue against X without losing credit in the eyes of the audience.

13. Create a False Dilemma (the Great Either/Or)

    > A true dilemma occurs when we are forced to choose between two equally unsatisfactory alternatives. A false dilemma occurs when we are persuaded that we have only two, equally unsatisfactory choices, when we really have more than two possibilities available to us.

14. Devise Analogies (and Metaphors) That Support Your View (even if they are misleading or "false")

    > An analogy or metaphor is a comparison that is not literally true.
    >
    > To win arguments, then, manipulators use comparisons that make them look good and their opponent look bad.
    >
    > The analogies and metaphors that work depend in part on the prejudices and beliefs of the audience. This means understanding the worldivew of the audience, as well as the root metaphors underlying them.

15. Question Your Opponent's Conclusions

    > The manipulator wants to lead the audience to accept his conclusions.

16. Create Misgivings:Where There's Smoke, There's Fire

    > The manipulator knows that once serious charges are made against a person, it may be difficult if not impossible for the accused to clear away the suspicion that there must have been `something` to the charge.

17. Create a Straw Man

    > Manipulators know the importance of making their opponents look bad. Whatever the views of the opponent, a skilled spin master can make the opponent appear to take another, far less believable, view.

18. Deny or Defend Inconsistencies

    > Manipulators know one looks bad when appearing to be inconsistent, saying one thing and doing another, or sometimes supporting X and sometimes attacking it. When caught in a contradiction, the manipulator has two choices. He can either deny that there is any contradiction at all or he can admit the contradiction and defend it as a justifiable change.

19. Demonize His Side, Sanitize Yours

    > Most people are not sophisticated. To manipulate them into accepting your side, systematically use "good" words to characterize it, while you systematically use "negative" words to characterize your opponent.

20. Evade Questions, Gracefully

    > One way to evade a hard question is to answer it with a joke that deflects the question. Another is to give a truistic answer.

21. Hedge What You Say

    > Manipulators often hide behind words, refusing to commit themselves or give direct answers.

22. Hedge What You Say

    > Manipulators often hide behind words, refusing to commit themselves or give direct answers.

23. Ignore the Evidence

    > In order to avoid considering evidence that might cause them to change their position, manipulators often ignore evidence. Usually they ignore the evidence in order to avoid having to consider it in their own minds, because it threatens their belief system or vested interests.

24. Ignore the Main Point

    > Manipulators know that if you can't win a point, you should divert your audience from it and focus on another point (a point not relevant to the original issue).

25. Attack Evidence (that undermines your case)

    > When a manipulator cannot successfully dodge consideration of evidence that does not support his case, he often attacks that evidence.

26. Insist Loudly on a Minor Point

    > Manipulators know that a good way to distract most people (if it looks like they are losing the argument) is to insist loudly on some minor point. Because most people think superficially, few will notice that the point is minor, especially if they are emotionally attached to it.

27. Use the Hard-Cruel-World Argument (to justify doing what is usually considered unethical)

    > When individuals or countries gain a lot of power, they soon come to believe that they should be able to do pretty much what they want to do. They do this by convincing themselves that their ends are always noble and just, that the only negative things they do in the world are forced on them by evil others who do not share their noble values.

28. Make (Sweeping) Glittering Generalizations

    > Manipulators, con artists, spin masters, and politicians will use any generalizations that support their case and that their audience will accept, regardless of whether they have sufficient evidence to support those generalizations.

29. Make Much of Any Inconsistencies in Your Opponent's Position

    > There is inconsistency in the best of us. Everyone sometimes fails to practice what he preaches. Everyone sometimes falls into a double standard. Manipulators exploit any inconsistencies they can find in their opponents' arguments.

30. Make Your Opponent Look Ridiculous ("Lost in the Laugh")

    > Manipulators look for ways to make their opponent, or his position, look ridiculous (and therefore funny).

31. Oversimplify the Issue

    > Since most people are uncomfortable making sense of deep or subtle arguments, manipulators oversimplify the issue to their advantage.

32. Raise Nothing but Objections

    > Your opponent is giving good reasons to accept an argument, but the fact is your mind is made up and nothing will change it (of course you don't want to admit that your mind is closed). Skilled manipulators respond with objection after objection after objection.

33. Rewrite History (have it your way)

    > The worst deeds and atrocities can disappear from historical accounts (or be made to appear minor) while fantasies and fabrications can be made to look like hard facts.

34. Seek Your Vested Interests

    > The manipulator attacks his opponent's motivation, but insists that his motives are pure. He covers his true motives (i.e. whatever is in his vested interest) by expressing high ideals (freedom, democracy, justice, the American way, which he in fact ignores).

35. Shift the Ground

    > When a manipulator senses the is losing the argument, he does not give in.

36. Shift the Burden of Proof

    > The burden of proof refers to which party in a dispute has the responsibility to prove what he asserts.

37. Spin, Spin, Spin

    > The manipulator must continually foster the spin that obscures viewpoints he opposes, while at the same time positively representing his own viewpoint (the one he wants the audience to accept).

38. Talk in Vague Generalities

    > It is hard to prove people wrong when they can't be pinned down. So instead of focusing on particulars, manipulators talk in the most vague terms they can get away with. This fallacy is popular with politicians.

39. Talk Double Talk

    > In double talk (sometimes called doublespeak), we use a positive word or phrase when we do something and a negative word when our opponents do precisely the same thing.

40. Tell Big Lies

    > Most people lie about small things but would be afraid to lie about big things. But manipulators know that if you insist on a lie long enough, many people will believe you--especially if you have the resources of mass media to air your lie.

41. Treat Abstract Words and Symbols As If They Were Real Things

42. Throw in a Red Herring (or two)

    > In this strategy, manipulators divert from the issue by focusing on what is irrelevant (but emotionally loaded).

43. Throw in Some Statistics

    > People are impressed by numbers, especially precise numbers. So whenever they can, manipulators quote statistics in their favor, even if the source is questionable.

44. Use Double Standards (whenever you can)

    > Most audiences use double standards. One standard for us. Another standard for them.
