# 1 The Role of Algorithms in Computing



## 1.1 Algorithms

An `algorithm` is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as `input` and produces some value, or set of values, as `output`.

Here is how we formally define the `sorting problem`:

​    Input: A sequence of $n$ numbers $(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)$.

​    Output: A permutation (reordering) $(a_1', a_2', ..., a_n')$ of the input sequence such that $a_1' \leq a_2' \leq ... \leq a_n'$.



## 1.2 Algorithms as a technology

Different algorithms devised to solve the same problem often differ dramatically in their `efficiency`. These differences can be much more significant than differences due to hardware and software.
