# CHAPTER 11 The Efficient Market Hypothesis

The `weak-form` hypothesis asserts that stock prices already reflect all information that can be derived by examining market trading data such as the history of past prices, trading volume, or short interest.

The `semistrong-form` hypothesis states that all publicly available information regarding the prospects of a firm must be reflected already in the stock price.

The `strong-form` version of the efficient market hypothesis states that stock prices reflect all information relevant to the firm, even including information available only to company insiders.

`Technical analysis` is essentially the search for recurrent and predictable patterns in stock prices. The key to successful technical analysis is a sluggish response of stock prices to fundamental supply-and-demand factors.

One of the successful technical analyses is a sluggish response of stock prices to fundamental supply-and-demand factors.

One of the most commonly heard components of technical analysis is the notion of `resistance levels` or `support levels`.

`Fundamental analysis` uses earnings and dividend prospects of the firm, expectations of future interest rates, and risk evaluation of the firm to determine proper stock prices.

A `passive investment strategy` that makes no attempt to outsmart the market. A passive strategy aims only at establishing a well-diversified portfolio of securities without attempting to find under or overvalued stocks.

One common strategy for passive management is to create an `index fund`, which is a fund designed to replicate the performance of a broad-based index of stocks.

An `event study` describes a technique of empirical financial research that enables an observer to assess the impact of a particular event on a firm's stock price.

The general approach starts with a proxy for what the stock's return would have been in the absence of the event. The `abnormal return` due to the event is estimated as the difference between the stock's actual return and this benchmark.

A single-index model holds that stock returns are determined by a market factor and a firm-specific factor. The stock return $r_t$, during a given period $t$, would be expressed mathematically as:
$$
r_t = a + b r_{M_t} + e_t
$$
, where $r_{M_t}$ is the market's rate of return during the period and $e_t$ is the part of a security's return resulting from firm-specific events. The parameter $b$ measures sensitivity to the market return, and $a$ is the average rate of return the stock would realize in a period with a zero market return. Above equation therefore provides a decomposition of $r_t$ into market and firm-specific factors. The firm-specific or abnormal return may be interpreted as the unexpected return that results from the event.

, Determination of the abnormal return in a given period reuqires an estimate of $e_t$. Therefore, we rewrite above equation:
$$
e_t = r_t - (a - br_{M_t})
$$
`cumulative abnormal return`, which is simply the sum of all abnormal returns over the time period of interest.

`Returns over Short Horizons` Early tests of efficient markets were tests of the weak form.

`momentum effect` in which good or bad recent performance of particular stocks continues over time.

Tests of long-horizon returns (i.e., returns over multiyear periods) have found suggestions of pronounced `negative` long-term serial correlation in the performance of the aggregate market.

`Book-to-Market Ratios` Fama and French showed that a powerful predictor of returns across securities is the ratio of the book value of the firm's equity to the market value of equity.

`Post-Earnings-Announcement Price Drift` A fundamental principle of efficient markets is that any new information ought to be reflected in stock prices very rapidly.

The conventional performance benchmark today is a foru-factor model, which employs the three Fama-French factors (the return on the market index, and returns to portfolios based on size and book-to-market ratio) augmented by a momentum factor (a portfolio constructed base on prior-year stock return). Alphas constructed using an expanded index model using these four factors control for a wide range of mutual fund style choices that may affect average returns.
