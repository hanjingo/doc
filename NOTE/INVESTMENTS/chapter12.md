# CHAPTER 12 Behavioral Finance and Technical Analysis



The premise of `behavioral finance` is that conventional financial theory ignores how real people make decisions and that people make a difference.

Errors in information processing can lead investors to misestimate the true probabilities of possible events or associated rates of return. Several such biases have been uncovered. Here are four of the more important ones:

- **Forecasting Errors** A series of experiments by Kahneman and Tversky indicate that people give too much weight to recent experience compared to prior beliefs when making forecasts (sometimes dubbed a `memory bias`) and tend to make forecasts that are too extreme given the uncertainty inherent in their information.
- **Overconfidence** People tend to overestimate the precision of their beliefs or forecasts, and they tend to overestimate their abilities.
- **Conservatism** A `conservatism` bias means that investors are too slow (too conservative) in updating their beliefs in response to new evidence. This means that they might initially underreact to news about a firm, so that prices will fully reflect new information only gradually. Such a bias would give rise to momentum in stock market returns.
- **Sample Size Neglect and Representativeness** The notion of `representativeness bias` holds that people commonly do not take into account the size of a sample, acting as if a small sample is just as representative of a population as a large one.

Even if information processing were perfect, many studies conclude that individuals would tend to make less-than-fully-rational decisions using that information. These behavioral biases largely affect how investors frame questions of risk versus return, and therefore make risk-return trade-offs:

- **Framing** Decisions seem to be affected by how choices are `framed`.
- **Mental Accounting** `Mental accounting` is a specific form of framing in which people segregate certain decisions.
- **Regret Avoidance** Psychologists have found that individuals who make decisions that turn out badly have more regret (blame themselves more) when that decision was more unconventional.

`Prospect theory` modifies the analytic description of rational risk-averse investors found in standard financial theory.

Behavioral advocates argue that in practice, several factors limit the ability to profit from mispricing:

- Fundamental Risk
- Implementation Costs
- Model Risk

Ross shows that if a fund has a dividend yield of $\delta$, an alpha (risk-adjusted abnormal return) of $\alpha$, and expense ratio of $\varepsilon$, then using the constant-growth dividend discount model, the premium of the fund over its net asset value will be:
$$
\frac{Price - NAV}{NAV} = \frac{\alpha - \varepsilon}{\delta + \varepsilon - \alpha}
$$
, If the fund manager's performance more than compensates for expenses (i.e., if $\alpha > \varepsilon$), the fund will sell at a premium to $NAV$; otherwise it will sell at a discount.

`disposition effect` which refers to the tendency of investors to hold on to losing investments. Behavioral investors seem reluctant to realize losses. This disposition effect can lead to momentum in stock prices even if fundamental values follow a random walk.

**Momentum and Moving Averages** While we all would like to buy shares in firms whose price are trending upward, this begs the question of how to identify the underlying direction of prices, if in fact such trends actually exist. A popular tool used for this purpose is the moving average.

The moving average of a stock price is the average price over a given interval, where that interval is updated as time passes.

**Relative strength** measures the extent to which a security has outperformed or underperformed either the market as a whole or its particular industry. Relative strength is computed by calculating the ratio of the price of the security to a price index for the industry.

**Breath** The breadth of the market is a measure of the extent to which movement in a market index is reflected widely in the price movements of all the stocks in the market.

**Trin Statistic** Market volume is sometimes used to measure the strength of a market rise or fall. Increased investor participation in a market advance or retreat is viewed as a measure of the significance of the movement. Technicians consider market advances to be a more favorable omen of continued price increases when they are associated with increased trading volume. Similarly, market reversals are considered more bearish when associated with higher volume. The `trin statistic` is defined as:
$$
Trin = \frac{\text{Volume declining/Number declining}}{\text{Volume advancing/Number advancing}}
$$
, Therefore, trin is the ratio of average volume in declining issues to average volume in advancing issues. Ratios above 1.0 are considered bearish because the falling stocks would then have higher average volume than the advancing stocks, indicating net selling pressure. `The Wall Street Journal Online` provides the data necessary to compute trin in its Markets Diary section.

**Confidence Index** Barron's computes a confidence index using data from the bond market. The presumption is that actions of bond traders reveal trends that will emerge soon in the stock market.

The `confidence index` is the ratio of the average yield on 10 top-rated corporate bonds divided by the average yield on 10 intermediate-grade corporate bonds. The ratio will always be below 100% because higher-rated bonds will offer lower promised yields to maturity. When bond traders are optimistic about the economy, however, they might require smaller default premiums on lower-rated debt. Hence, the yield spread will narrow, and the confidence index will approach 100%. Therefore, higher values of the confidence index are bullish signals.

**Put/Call Ratio** Call options give investors the right to buy a stock at a fixed "exercise" price and therefore are a way of betting on stock price increases. Put options give the right to sell a stock at a fixed price and therefore are a way of betting on stock price decreases. The ratio of outstanding put options to outstanding call options is called teh `put/call ratio`. Typically, the put/call ratio hovers around 65%. Because put options do well in falling markets while call options do well in rising markets, deviations of the ratio from historical norms are considered to be a signal of market sentiment and therefore predictive of market movements.
