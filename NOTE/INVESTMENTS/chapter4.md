# CHAPTER 4 Mutual Funds and Other Investment Companies

`Investment companies` are financial intermediaries that collect funds from individual investors and invest those funds in a potentially wide range of securitites or other assets.

Investment companies perform several important functions for their investors:

1. Record keeping and administration.
2. Diversification and divisibility.
3. Professional management.
4. Lower transaction costs.

The value of each share is called the `net asset value`, or `NAV`. Net asset value equals assets minus liabilities expressed on a per-share basis:
$$
Net asset value = \frac{Market value of assets minus liabilities}{Share outstanding}
$$
`Unit investment trusts` are pools of money invested in a portfolio that is fixed for the life of the fund.

There are two types of managed companies: 

- closed-end: Open-end funds stand ready to redeem or issue shares at their net asset value(although both purchases and redemptions may involve sales charges).
- open-end: closed-end funds do not redeem or issue shares.

`Commingled Funds` are partnerships of investors that pool funds.

`Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)` invest in real estate or loans secured by real estate. Besides issuing shares, they raise capital by borrowing from banks and issuing bonds or mortgages.

`Hedge Funds` are vehicles that allow private investors to pool assets to be invested by a fund manager.

`Money Market Funds` invest in money market securities such as commercial paper, repurchase agreements, or certificates of deposit.

`Equity Funds` invest primarily in stock, although they may, at the portfolio manager's discretion, also hold fixed-income or other types of securities.

`Sector Funds` Some equity funds, called `sector` funds, concentrate on a particular industry.

`Bond Funds` As the same suggests, these funds specialize in the fixed-income sector.

`International Funds` Many funds have international focus. `Global funds` invest in securities worldwide, including the United States. In Contrast, `international funds` invest in securities of firms located outside the United States. `Regional funds` concentrate on a particular part of the world, and `emerging market funds` invest in companies of developing nations.

`Balanced Funds` Some funds are designed to be candidates for an individual's entire investment portfolio.

`Asset Allocation and Flexible Funds` are similar to balanced funds in that they hold both stocks and bonds.

An `Index Funds` tries to match the performance of a broad market index.

`Operating Expenses` are the costs incurred by the mutual fund in operating the portfolio, including administrative expenses and advisory fees paid to the investment manager.

A `Front-End Load` is a commission or sales charge paid when you purchase the shares.

A `Back-End Load` is a redemption, or "exit", fee incurred when you sell your shares.

The Securities and Exchange Commission allows the managers of so-called 12b-1 funds to use fund assets to pay for distribution costs such as advertising, promotional literature including annual reports and prospectuses, and, most important, commissions paid to brokers who sell the fund to investors.

The rate of return on an investment in a mutual fund is measured as the increase or decrease in net asset value plus income distributions such as dividends or distributions of capital gains expressed as a fraction of net asset value at the beginning of the investment period. If we denote the net asset value at the start and end of the period as $NAV_0$ and $NAV_1$, respectively, then:
$$
Rate of return = \frac{NAV_1 - NAV_0 + Income and capital gain distributions}{NAV_0}
$$
, notice that this measure of the rate of return ignores any commissions such as front-end loads paid to purchase the fund.

`Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)`, first introduced in 1993, are offshoots of mutual funds that allow investors to trade index portfolios just as they do shares of stock.
