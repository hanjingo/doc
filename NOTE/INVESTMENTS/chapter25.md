# CHAPTER 25 International Diversification

Pure `exchange rate risk` is the risk borne by investments in foreign safe assets.

The ex-post efficient frontier (derived from realized returns) describes the portfolio of only one investor--the clairvoyant who actually predicted the precise averages of realized returns on all assets and estimated a covariance matrix that materialized precisely in the actual realizations of the sample period returns on all assets.

The three rules of thumb are to include country indexes in order of:

1. `Market capitalization (from high to low).` This rule is motivated by a world CAPM consideration in which the optimal portfolio is capitalization-weighted.
2. `Beta against the U.S.(from low to high).` This rule concerntrates on diversifying the risk associated with investments in higher-risk countries.
3. `Country index standard deviation (from high to low).` This rule is motivated by the observation that higher country standard deviations (SDs) are correlated with higher average returns. It relies on diversification to mitigate individual-country risk.

1. `Currency selection`
2. `Country selection`
3. `Stock selection`
4. `Cash/bond selection`
