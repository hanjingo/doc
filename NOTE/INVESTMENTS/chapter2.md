# CHAPTER 2 Asset Classes and Financial Instruments



The `ask price` is the price you would have to pay to buy a T-bill from a securities dealer.

The `bid price` is the sligntly lower price you would receive if you wanted to sell a bill to a dealer.

The `bid-ask spread` is the difference in these prices, which is the dealer's source of profit.

A `certificate of deposit`, or CD, is a time deposit with a bank.

Large, well-known companies often issue their own short-term unsecured debt notes rather tahn borrow directly from banks. These notes are called `commercial paper`.

A `banker's acceptance` starts as an order to a bank by a bank's customer to pay a sum of money at a future date, typically within 6 months.

`Eurodollars` are dollar-denominated deposits at foreign banks or foreign branches of American banks.

Dealers in government securities use `repurchase agreements`, also called "repos" or "RPs", as a form of short-term, usually overnight, borrowing.

Funds in the bank's reserve account are called `federal funds`, or `fed funds`. In the federal funds market, banks with excess funds lend to those with a shortage. These loans, which are usually overnight transactions, are arranged at a rate of interest called the `federal funds rate`.

Individuals who buy stocks on margin borrow part of the funds to pay for the stocks from their broker.

The `London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)` is the rate at which large banks in London are willing to lend money among themselves.

The U.S. goernment borrows funds in large part by selling `Treasury notes` and `Treasury bonds`.

Both notes and bonds make semiannual interest payments called `coupon payments`, a name derived from precomputer days, when investors would literally clip coupons attached to the bond and pressent a coupon to receive the interest payment.

The `yield to maturity` reported in the financial pages is calculated by determining the semiannual yield and then doubling it, rather than compounding it for two half-year periods.This use of a simple interest technique to annualize means that the yield is quoted on an annual percentage rate (APR) basis rather as an effective annual yield. The APR method in this context is also called the `bond equivalent yield`.

`Common stocks`, also known as `equity securities` or `equities`, represent ownership shares in a corporation.

A `futures contract` calls for delivery of an asset (or in some cases, its cash value) at specified delievery or maturity date for an agreed-upon price, called the future price, to be paid at contract maturity. The `long position` is held by the trader who commits to purchasing the asset on the delivery data. The trader who takes the `short position` commits to delivering date. The trader who takes the `short position` commits to delivering the asset at contract maturity.

Funds in the bank's reserve account are called `federal funds`, or `fed funds`.

The `London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)` is the rate at which large banks in London are willing to lend money among themselves. This are, which is quoted on dollar denominated loans, has become the premier short-term interest rate quoted in the European money market, and it serves as a reference rate for a wide range of transactions.

Although most money market securities are of low risk, they are not risk-free. The securities of the money market promise yields greater than those on default-free T-bills, at least in part because of greater relative riskiness. In addition, many investors require more liquidity; thus they will accept lower yields on securities such as T-bills that can be quickly and cheaply sold for cash.

The U.S. government borrows funds in large part by selling `Treasury notes` and `Treasury bonds`. T-notes are issued with maturities ranging up to 10 years, while bonds are issued with maturities ranging from 10 to 30 years. Both notes and bands make semiannual interest payments called `coupon payments`, a name derived from precomputer days, when investors would literally clip coupons attached to the bond and present a coupon to receive the interest payment.

The `yield to maturity` reported in the financial pages is calculated by determining the semiannual yield and then doubling it, rather than compounding it for two half-year periods.

In the United States inflation-protected Treasury bonds are called TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities).

A `Eurobond` is a bond denominated in a currency other than that of the country in which it is issued.

`Municipal bonds` are issued by state and local governments. They are similar to Treasury and corporate bonds except that their interest income is exempt from federal income taxation. 

An `industrial development bond` is a revenue bond that is issued to finance commercial enterprises, such as the construction of a factory that can be operated by a private firm. 

A good deal of the debt issued is the form of short-term `tax anticipation notes`, which raise funds to pay for expenses before actual collection of taxes.

If we let $t$ denote the investor's combined federal plus local marginal tax bracket and $r$ denote the total before-tax rate of return available on taxable bonds, then $r(1-t)$ is the after-tax rate available on those securities. If this value exceeds the rate on municipal bonds, $r_m$, the investor does better holding the taxable bonds. Otherwise, the tax-exempt municipals provide higher after-tax returns. One way to compare bonds is to determine the interest rate on taxable bonds that would be necessary to provide an after-tax return equal to that of municipals. To derive this value, we set after-tax yields equal and solve for the `equivalent taxable yield` of the tax-exempt bond. This is the rate a taxable bond must offer to match the after-tax yield on the tax-free municipal:
$$
r(1 - t) = r_m
$$
, or
$$
r = r_m / (1 - t)
$$
, thus the equivalent taxable yield is simply the tax-free rate divided by $1 - t$.

We find that:
$$
t = 1 - \frac{r_m}{r}
$$
, thus the yield ratio $r_m / r$ is a key determinant of the attractiveness of municipal bonds. The higher the yield ratio, the lower the cutoff tax bracket, and the more individuals will prefer to hold municipal debt.

Corporate bonds are the means by which private firms borrow money directly from the public.

A `mortgage-backed security` is either an ownership claim in a pool of mortgages or an obligation that is secured by such a pool.

`Common stocks`, also known as `equity securities` or equities, represent ownership shares in a corporation.

The two most important characteristics of common stock as an investment are its `residual claim` and `limited liability` features.

Residual claim means that stockholders are the last in line of all those who have a claim on the assets and income of the corporation.

Limited liability means that the most shareholders can lose in the event of failure of the corporation is their original investment.

The dividend yield is only part of the return on a stock investment. It ignores prospective `capital gains`(i.e, price increases) or losses.

The P/E ratio, or `price-earnings ratio`, is the ratio of the current stock price to last year's earnings per share. The P/E ratio tells us how much stock purchasers must pay per dollar of earnings that the firm generates.

`Preferred stock` has features similar to both equity and debt.

Because the Dow corresponds to a portfolio that holds one share of each component stock, the investment in each company in that portfolio is proportional to the company's share price. Therefore, the Dow is called a `price-weighted average`.

The Standard & Poor's Composite 500 (S&P 500) stock index represents an improvement over the Dow Jones Averages in two ways. First, it is a more broadly based index of 500 firms. Second, it is a `market-value-weighted index`.

`exchange-traded fund`, or ETF, which is a portfolio of shares that can be bought or sold as a unit, just as one can buy or sell a single share of stock. Available ETFs range from portfolios that track extremely broad global market indexes all the way to narrow industry indexes.

A `call option` gives its holder the right to purchase an asset for a specified price, called the `exercise` or `strike price`, on or before a specified expiration date.

A `put option` gives its holder the right to sell an asset for a specified exercise price on before a specified expiration date.

A `futures contract` calls for delivery of an asset (or in some cases, its cash value) at a specified delivery or maturity date for an agreed-upon price, called the futures price, to be paid at contract maturity. The `long position` is held by the trader who commits to purchasing the asset on the delivery date. The trader who takes the `short position` commits to delivering the asset at contract maturity.
