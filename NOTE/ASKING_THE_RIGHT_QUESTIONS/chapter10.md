# CHAPTER 10 Are There Rival Causes?

trying to figure out what caused something to happen. We cannot determine an intelligent approach to avoiding a problem or encouraging a particular positive outcome until we understand the causal pattern that gave rise to the phenomenon in the first place.

Attention: A rival cause is a plausible alternative explanation that can explain why a certain outcome occurred.

You need to look for rival causes when you have good reason to believe that the writer or speaker is using evidence to support a claim about the cause of something.

Lessons Learned:

1. Many kinds of events are open to explanation by rival causes.
2. Experts can examine the same evidence and "discover" different causes to explain it.
3. Most communicators will provide you with only their favored causes; the critical reader or listener must generate rival causes.
4. Generating rival causes is a creative process; usually such causes will not be obvious.
5. Finally, the certainty of a particular causal claim is inversely related to the number of plausible rival causes. Hence, identifying the multiple rival causes gives the critical thinker the proper sense of intellectual humility.

When you recognize situations in which rival causes are possible, you want to ask yourself questions like:

- Can I think of any other way to interpret the evidence?
- What else might have caused this act or these findings?
- If I looked at this from another point of view, what might I see as important causes?
- If this interpretation is incorrect, what other interpretation might make sense?

Causal Oversimplification: Explaining an event by relying on causal factors that are insufficient to account for the event or by overemphasizing the role of one or more of these factors.

One of the most common ways for researchers to try to find a cause for some event is to `compare groups`.

Remember: Many factors can cause research groups to differ!

Remember: Association or correlation does not prove causation!

> Explanation 1: $X is a cause of Y$.
>
> Explanation 2: $Y is a cause of X$.
>
> Explanation 3: $X and Y are associated because of some third factor, Z$.
>
> Explanation 4: $X and Y influence each other$.

Confusion of Cause and Effect: Confusing the cause with the effect of an event or failing to recognize that the two events may be influencing each other.

Neglect of a Common Cause: Failure to recognize that two events may be related because of the effects of a common third factor.

Post hoc Fallacy: Assuming that a particular event, B, is caused by another event, A, simply because B follows A in time.

Remember: The finding that one event follows another in time does not by itself prove causation; it may be only a coincidence.

In comparing causes, we suggest that you apply the following criteria:

1. their logical soundness;
2. their consistency with other knowledge that you have; and
3. their previous success in explaining or predicting events.
