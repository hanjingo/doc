# CHAPTER 5 What Are the Value Conflicts and Assumptions?

Remember: the visible surface of an argument will almost always be dressed in its best clothes because the person presenting the argument wishes to encourage you to make the argument your own.

Assumptions are:

1. hidden or unstated (in most cases);
2. taken for grated;
3. influential in determining the conclusion; and
4. potentially deceptive.

Look for value assumptions in the movement from reasons to conclusion!

An assumption is an unstated belief that supports the explicit reasoning.

Values are the unstated ideas that people see as worthwhile. They provide standards of conduct by which we measure the quality of human behavior.

Common Values:

```txt
adventure, ambition, autonomy, collective responsibility, comfort, competition, cooperation, courage, creativity, equality of opportunity, excellence, flexibility, freedom of speech, generosity, harmony, honesty, justice, novelty, order, peace, rationality, security, spontaneity, tolerance, tradition, wisdom
```

A value assumption is an implicit preference for one value over another in a particular context. We use value preferences and value priorities as synonyms.

Typical Value Conflict and Sample Controversies:

1. loyalty-honesty

   Should you tell your parents about your sister's drug habit?

2. competition-cooperation

   Do you support the grading system?

3. freedom of press-national security

   Is it wise to hold weekly presidential press conferences?

4. equality-individualism

   Are racial quotas for employment fair?

5. order-freedom of speech

   Should we imprison those with radical ideas?

6. security-excitement

   Should you choose a dangerous profession?

7. generosity-material success

   Is it desirable to give financial help to a beggar?

8. rationality-spontaneity

   Should you check the odds before placing a bet?

9. tradition-novelty

   Should divorces be easily available?

When you identify *value assumptions*, you should always try to state *value priorities*. 

Clues for Identifying Value Assumptions:

1. Investigate the author's background.
2. Ask "Why do the consequences of the author's position seem so important to her?"
3. Search for similar social controversies to find analogous value assumptions.
4. Use reverse role-playing. Take a position opposite the author's position and identify which values are important to that opposite position.
5. Look for common value conflicts, such as individual responsibility versus community responsibility.
