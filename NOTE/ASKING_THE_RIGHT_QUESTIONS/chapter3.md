# CHAPTER 3 What are the Reasons?

You cannot determine the worth of a conclusion until you identify the reasons.

Reasons are explanations or rationales for why we should believe a particular conclusion.

Several characteristics of arguments grab our attention:

- They have intent.
- Their quality varies.
- They have two essential visible components--a conclusion and reasons.

An argument consists of a conclusion and the reasons that allegedly support it.

The structure of reasoning is `this, because of that`.

The conclusion itself will not be evidence; it will be a belief supported by evidence or by other beliefs.

Clues for Identifying and Organizing the Reasoning of a Passage:

1. Circle indicator words.
2. Underline the reasons and conclusion in different colors of ink, or highlight the conclusion and underline the reasons.
3. Label the reasons and conclusion in the margin.
4. After reading long passages, make a list of reasons at the end of the essay.
