# CHAPTER 8 How Good Is the Evidence: intuition, Personal Experience, Testimonials, and Appeals to Authority?



We encounter factual claims as:

- descriptive conclusions.
- reasons.
- descriptive assumptions.

There are three instances in which we will be most inclined to agree with a factual claim:

1. when the claim appears to be undisputed common knowledge, such as the claim "weight lifting increases muscular body mass;"
2. when the claim is the conclusion from a well-reasoned argument;
3. when the claim is adequately supported by solid evidence in the same communication or by other evidence that we know.

Major kinds of evidence include:

- intuition.
- personal experience.
- testimonials.
- appeals to authorities.
- personal observations.
- case examples.
- research studies.
- analogies.

Hasty Generalization Fallacy: A person draws a conclusion about a large group based on experiences with only a few members of the group.

We should be especially wary of each of the following problems with testimonials:

- Selectivity.
- Personal interest.
- Omitted information.
- The human factor.



## Summary

Clues for Evaluating the Evidence

Use the following questions to help assess the various kinds of evidence:

1. Intuition
   - Does the intuition have any other kind of evidential support?
2. Authority
   - How much expertise or training does the authority have on this particular subject?
   - Was the authority in a position to have especially good access to pertinent facts?
   - Is there good reason to believe that authority is relatively free from distorted influences?
   - Has the authority developed a reputation for frequently making dependable claims?
   - Have we been able to rely on this authority in the past?
3. Personal Testimony
   - What biases or interests might be affecting the person's testimony?
   - Does the person have any expertise to assist his or her judgment?
   - How do the person's value assumptions affect his or her testimony?
   - Whose personal testimony might be helpful in assessing this person's testimony?
   - What information has been left out in this personal testimony?
