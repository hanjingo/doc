# CHAPTER 9 How Good Is the Evidence: Personal Observation, Research Studies, Case Examples, and Analogies?

How good is the evidence: personal observation, research studies, case examples, and analogies?

When communicators appeal to research as a source of evidence, you should remember the following:

1. Research varies greatly in `quality`;
2. Research findings often contradict one another.
3. Research findings `do not prove` conclusions.
4. Like all of us, researchers have expectations, attitudes, values, and needs that bias the questions they ask, the way they conduct their research, and the way they interpret their research findings.
5. Speakers and writers often distort or simplify research conclusions.
6. Research "facts" change over time, especially claims about human behavior.
7. Research varies in how artificial it is.
8. The need for financial gain, status, security, and other factors can affect research outcomes.



## Clues for Evaluating Research Studies

Apply these questions to research findings to determine whether the findings are dependable evidence:

1. `What is the quality of the source of the report?`
2. `does the report detail any special strengths of the research?`
3. `Has the study been replicated?`
4. `How selective has the communicator been in choosing studies?`
5. `Is there any evidence of strong-sense critical thinking?`
6. `Is there any reason for someone to have distorted the research?`
7. `Are conditions in the research artificial and therefore distorted?`
8. `How far can we generalize, given the research sample?`
9. `Are there any biases or distortions in the surveys, questionnaires, ratings, or other measurements that the researcher uses?`

You need to keep several important considerations in mind when evaluating the research sample:

1. The sample must be large enough to justify the generalization or conclusion.
2. The sample must possess as much `breadth`, or diversity, as the types of events about which conclusions are to be drawn.
3. The more `random` the sample, the better.

Remember: We can generalize only to people and events that are like those that we have studied in the research!

Remember: You cannot assume that verbal reports accurately reflect true attitudes.

Survey and questionnaire data must always be examined for possible bias. `Look carefully at the wording of the questions!`

In long surveys, people may respond differently to later items than to earlier items simply because they get tired. `Be alert to contextual factors when evaluating survey results.`

Dramatic cases `appeal to our emotions` and distract us from seeking other more relevant research evidence.

To evaluate the quality of an analogy, you need to focus on two factors:

1. The number of ways the two things are being compared are similar and different.
2. The `relevance` of the similarities and the differences.

Relevant similarities and differences are ones that directly relate to the underlying principle illustrated by the analogy.

A productive way to generate your own analogies is the following:

1. Identify some important features of what you are studying.
2. Try to identify other situations with which you are familiar that have some similar features. Give free rein to your imagination. Brainstorm. Try to imagine diverse situations.
3. Try to determine whether the familiar situation can provide you with some insights about the unfamiliar situation.

Faulty Analogy: Occurs when an analogy is proposed in which there are important relevant dissimilarities.
