# CHAPTER 7 Are There Any Fallacies in the Reasoning?

The objective of critical reading and listening is to judge the acceptability or worth of conclusions.

Three common tricks are:

1. providing reasoning that requires `erroneous or incorrect assumptions;`
2. `distracting us` by making information seem relevant to the conclusion when it is not; and
3. providing support for the conclusion that depends on the conclusion's already being true.

A fallacy is a reasoning "trick" that an author might use while trying to persuade you to accept a conclusion.

We suggest that you adopt the following thinking steps in locating fallacies:

1. Identify the conclusions and reasons.
2. Always keep the conclusion in mind and consider reasons that you think might be relevant to it; contrast these reasons with the author's reasons.
3. If the conclusion supports an action, determine whether the reason states a specific and/or concrete advantage or a disadvantage; if not, be wary!
4. Identify any necessary assumption by asking yourself, "If the reason were true, what would one have to believe for it to logically support the conclusion, and what does one have to believe for the reason to be true?"
5. Ask yourself, "Do these assumptions make sense?" If an obviously false assumption is being made, you have found a fallacy in reasoning, and that reasoning can then be rejected.
6. Check the possibility of being distracted from relevant reasons by phrases that strongly appeal to your emotions.
