## Why HFT

The advantages of high-frequency trading in the developing electronic markets are two-fold:

- First-to-market high-frequency traders in the newly electronic markets are likely to capture significant premiums on their speculative activity simply because of the lack of competition.
- In the long term, none of the markets is a zero-sum game. The diverse nature of market participants ensures that all players are able to extract value according to their own metrics.



## Define

- Orders to buy or sell a security at the best available price when the order is placed are known as **market orders**. Orders to buy or sell a security at a particular price are known as **limit orders**.



## Performance Attribution

Performance attribution is a useful measure of strategy returns for the following reasons:

- The technique may accurately capture investment styles of black-box strategies in addition to the details reported by the designer of the strategy.
- Performance attribution is a measure of true added value of the strategy and lends itself to easy comparison with other strategies.
- Near-term persistence of trending factors allows forecasting of strategy performance based on performance attribution.

Performance attribution equition:
$$
R_{it} = \alpha_{i} + \sum_{k}b_{ik}F_{kt} + u_{it}
$$

- $b_k$ measures the performance of the strategy that can be attributed to factor $k$;
- $\alpha_{i}$ measures the strategy's persistent ability to generate abnormal returns;
- $u_{it}$ measures the strategy's idiosyncratic return in period $t$.

The higher the Sharpe ratio, the shorter the strategy evaluation period needed to ascertain the validity of the Sharpe ratio.
