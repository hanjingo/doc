# Investment Income Analysis

## Introduction

Investment income analysis is a fundamental cornerstone of financial mathematics, providing essential tools and methodologies for evaluating the profitability and viability of investment opportunities. In an increasingly complex financial landscape, the ability to accurately assess and compare different investment options has become crucial for both individual and institutional investors. This analysis encompasses various quantitative techniques that help investors make informed decisions by measuring potential returns, assessing risks, and optimizing resource allocation.

The significance of investment income analysis extends beyond simple profit calculations. It involves sophisticated mathematical frameworks that account for the time value of money, cash flow timing, reinvestment opportunities, and various risk factors. These analytical tools enable investors to evaluate projects with different time horizons, cash flow patterns, and risk profiles on a comparable basis, ultimately supporting strategic financial decision-making.

This document provides a comprehensive overview of investment income analysis methods, drawing from established mathematical principles in finance to present both theoretical foundations and practical applications.

## Fundamental Concepts in Investment Analysis

### Time Value of Money

The cornerstone of all investment analysis lies in understanding the time value of money principle. This concept recognizes that money available today is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its earning potential.

#### Accumulation and Present Value Functions

The **accumulation function** $a(t)$ represents the value of one monetary unit invested at time 0 after time $t$. For compound interest calculations:

$$a(t) = (1 + i)^t$$

where $i$ is the effective interest rate per period.

The **discount function** (or present value function) is the inverse:

$$v^t = a^{-1}(t) = (1 + i)^{-t}$$

This discount factor $v = (1 + i)^{-1}$ is fundamental to all present value calculations in investment analysis.

#### Simple vs. Compound Interest

While simple interest grows linearly ($a(t) = 1 + it$), compound interest grows exponentially. For investment analysis, compound interest is predominantly used as it more accurately reflects real-world investment growth patterns where earnings are reinvested.

### Cash Flow Analysis

Investment opportunities typically involve a series of cash flows occurring at different time periods. These cash flows can be represented as:

$$C_0, C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_n$$

where $C_t$ represents the cash flow at time $t$. Positive values indicate cash inflows (returns), while negative values represent outflows (investments).

## Investment Analysis Methods

### Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

DCF analysis is the most fundamental method for evaluating investments. It calculates the present value of all expected future cash flows.

#### Net Present Value (NPV)

For any series of cash flows $R_0, R_1, \ldots, R_n$ occurring at times $0, 1, \ldots, n$, the Net Present Value is calculated as:

$$NPV = P(i) = \sum_{t=0}^{n} v^t R_t$$

For continuous cash flows $R_t$ over the interval $[0, n]$:

$$NPV = P(i) = \int_{0}^{n} v^t R_t \, dt$$

**Decision Rules:**
- If NPV > 0: Accept the investment (creates value)
- If NPV < 0: Reject the investment (destroys value)
- If NPV = 0: Investment is marginally acceptable

#### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

The Internal Rate of Return is the discount rate that makes the NPV equal to zero:

$$\sum_{t=0}^{n} \frac{C_t}{(1 + IRR)^t} = 0$$

The IRR provides an intuitive measure of investment profitability, representing the average annual return generated by the investment.

**Important Considerations:**
- IRR calculations assume cash flows can be reinvested at the IRR rate
- Multiple IRRs may exist for complex cash flow patterns
- IRR comparisons are only meaningful for projects with similar time horizons

### Outstanding Value Analysis

Outstanding value analysis tracks the investment's value at various points in time, providing insights into the investment's performance throughout its lifecycle.

#### Retrospective Method

The outstanding value $B_t^r$ at time $t$ using the retrospective method considers all cash flows from inception:

$$B_t^r = \sum_{s=0}^{t} (1 + i)^{t-s} C_s$$

#### Prospective Method

The outstanding value $B_t^p$ using the prospective method considers all remaining future cash flows:

$$B_t^p = \sum_{s=t+1}^{n} v^{s-t} C_s$$

#### Recursive Formulation

Outstanding values can also be calculated recursively:

$$\begin{cases}
B_0 = C_0 \\
B_t = B_{t-1}(1+i) + C_t, \quad t = 1, 2, \ldots, n
\end{cases}$$

This approach is particularly useful for tracking investment performance over time and identifying periods of positive or negative investment positions.

## Rate of Return Calculation Methods

Accurate rate of return calculation is crucial for investment performance evaluation. Two primary methodologies address different aspects of return measurement.

### Capital-Weighted Method (Dollar-Weighted Return)

The capital-weighted method considers the magnitude of cash flows but not their specific timing within periods. This approach is particularly useful when analyzing overall portfolio performance.

#### Single Period Analysis

For a single period investment with:
- $A$: Initial capital
- $B$: Ending capital  
- $C$: Net capital contributions during the period
- $I$: Interest income

The basic capital balance equation is:
$$B = A + C + I$$

Under compound interest assumptions, the interest income is:
$$I = iA + \sum_t C_t(1 + i)^{1-t} - C$$

This can be simplified to:
$$I = iA + (1 + i)\sum_t C_t v^t - C$$

#### Multi-Period Extension

For investments spanning multiple periods, the outstanding balance at time $k$ is:

$$B_k = B_0(1 + i)^k + \sum_{j=0}^{k} C_j(1 + i)^{k-j}$$

### Time-Weighted Method

The time-weighted method calculates returns for each sub-period between cash flows, then compounds these returns to obtain the overall return. This method eliminates the impact of cash flow timing and size.

#### Calculation Process

1. **Calculate Sub-period Returns**: For each period $k$:
   $$j_k = \frac{B_k}{B_{k-1} + C_{k-1}} - 1$$

2. **Compound Returns**: The overall return $i$ satisfies:
   $$1 + i = \prod_{k=1}^{m} (1 + j_k)$$

3. **Annualize if Necessary**: For multi-year periods:
   $$(1 + i)^n = \prod_{k=1}^{m} (1 + j_k)$$

### Method Comparison and Selection

**Capital-Weighted Method:**
- Reflects the actual dollar-weighted performance
- Influenced by timing and size of contributions
- Better for evaluating investor experience

**Time-Weighted Method:**
- Eliminates impact of cash flow timing
- Better for comparing manager performance
- Industry standard for mutual fund reporting

## Capital Budgeting and Project Evaluation

### Project Return Rate vs. Project Financing Rate

In capital budgeting, it's essential to distinguish between periods of net investment and net financing.

#### Definitions

- **Project Return Rate ($r$)**: The rate earned during periods when the project has a positive outstanding balance (net investment periods)
- **Project Financing Rate ($f$)**: The rate paid during periods when the project has a negative outstanding balance (net financing periods)

#### Mathematical Framework

The outstanding balance evolves according to:

$$B_t = \begin{cases}
B_{t-1}(1 + r) + C_t, & \text{if } B_{t-1} \geq 0 \\
B_{t-1}(1 + f) + C_t, & \text{if } B_{t-1} < 0
\end{cases}$$

This approach provides more realistic evaluation by recognizing that investment returns and financing costs typically differ.

#### Final Value Expression

The final outstanding balance can be expressed as:

$$B_n = \sum_{j=0}^{n} C_j (1 + r)^{m_j} (1 + f)^{n - m_j - j}$$

where $m_j$ represents the number of periods from time $j$ to time $n$ during which rate $r$ applies.

### Reinvestment Analysis

Understanding reinvestment assumptions is crucial for accurate investment analysis.

#### Single Investment with Periodic Returns

Consider an initial investment of one monetary unit with:
- Direct investment rate: $i$ per period
- Reinvestment rate: $j$ per period  
- Investment period: $n$ periods

The accumulated value incorporating reinvestment is:

$$1 + i \cdot s_{n|j}$$

where $s_{n|j} = \frac{(1+j)^n - 1}{j}$ is the accumulated value of an $n$-period ordinary annuity of 1 monetary unit per period at rate $j$.

**Key Insights:**
- When $j > i$: Reinvestment enhances total returns
- When $j < i$: Reinvestment reduces total returns  
- When $j = i$: Total return equals $(1 + i)^n$
