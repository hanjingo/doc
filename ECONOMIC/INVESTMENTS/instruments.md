# Investment Instruments

[TOC]

This note summarizes common financial instruments, their characteristics, risks, and typical uses. It condenses material from the INVESTMENTS notes into a practical reference for students and practitioners.

## Quick orientation

Investment instruments can be grouped by purpose and market:

- Money-market instruments: short-term, highly liquid debt (Treasury bills, commercial paper).
- Fixed-income (bonds): government, municipal, corporate bonds, characterized by maturity, coupon, credit risk.
- Equities: common and preferred stocks — ownership claims with variable returns and higher risk.
- Collective investment vehicles: mutual funds, ETFs, index funds.
- Derivatives: forwards, futures, options, swaps — contracts deriving value from underlying assets.
- Real assets and alternatives: real estate (REITs), commodities, private equity, hedge funds.
- Foreign exchange (FX) instruments and structured products.

Each instrument differs in liquidity, return profile, risk type (market, credit, liquidity), and tax treatment.

## Money-market instruments

Characteristics:

- Short maturities (overnight to 1 year), high liquidity, low default risk for government-issued instruments.
- Common instruments: Treasury bills (T-bills), commercial paper, certificates of deposit (CDs), repurchase agreements (repos).

Use cases: cash management, short-term parking of funds, liquidity buffers.

## Bonds and fixed-income securities

Key terms:

- Face value (par), coupon rate, yield to maturity (YTM), credit rating, maturity date.
- Price and yield move inversely; bond prices are sensitive to interest rate changes (duration and convexity measure interest-rate risk).

Types:

- Government bonds (e.g., Treasury), generally low credit risk.
- Corporate bonds, varying credit quality and yield spreads.
- Municipal bonds (tax advantages for some investors).
- Inflation-linked bonds (e.g., TIPS) protect real purchasing power.

Risks: interest-rate risk, credit/default risk, inflation risk, liquidity risk.

Example: A 5-year bond with 3% coupon and par 1000 — compute price given a market yield to maturity.

## Equities (stocks)

Equities represent ownership in a firm. Returns come from dividends and capital gains. Equities typically offer higher expected returns but greater volatility than bonds.

Classes:

- Common stock: voting rights, residual claim on earnings.
- Preferred stock: fixed dividends, priority over common stock in claims, hybrid between equity and debt.

Valuation approaches: discounted cash flows (DCF), dividend discount models (DDM), relative valuation (P/E, EV/EBITDA).

Risks: market risk, business risk, liquidity risk, event risk.

---

## Collective investment vehicles

Mutual funds and ETFs pool investor capital to buy diversified portfolios.

- Mutual funds: actively or passively managed, traded at NAV once per day, may have sales loads and management fees.
- Exchange-traded funds (ETFs): trade on exchanges intraday like stocks, often track indices with lower expense ratios.

Benefits: diversification, professional management, easy access to many asset classes.

Costs: management fees (expense ratio), tracking error for index funds, potential tax inefficiencies in some fund structures.

---

## Derivatives: forwards, futures, options, and swaps

Derivatives derive value from an underlying asset (commodity, security, index, interest rate, currency).

- Forwards and futures: contractual agreements to buy/sell an asset at a future date for a price agreed today. Futures are standardized and exchange-traded; forwards are OTC.
- Options: contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) the underlying at a strike price before or at expiry.
- Swaps: OTC agreements to exchange cash flows (e.g., interest rate swap exchanging fixed for floating payments).

Uses: hedging risk (price, interest rate, currency), speculation, arbitrage, and synthetic position creation.

Risks: counterparty risk (OTC), margin and leverage risk, model risk.

---

## Real assets & alternatives

- Real estate: direct property investment or via REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts).
- Commodities: physical goods (oil, metals, agricultural products) traded via futures and spot markets.
- Private equity and venture capital: illiquid, long-horizon investments in private companies.
- Hedge funds: often use leverage and alternative strategies (long/short, relative value, event-driven).

Alternatives often offer diversification but come with liquidity, fee, and due-diligence concerns.

---

## Foreign exchange (FX) instruments

FX instruments include spot FX, forwards, futures, and currency options. FX markets are large and liquid; exchange-rate risk affects international investments.

Hedging currency exposure is common for international portfolios.

---

## Structured products and hybrids

Structured products combine debt and derivatives to provide tailored payoff profiles (capital-protected notes, autocallables). They are typically issued by banks and have issuer credit risk.

Advice: understand payoff diagrams, fees, and embedded risks before investing in structured products.

---

## Risk and return considerations

- Expected return: compensation for time value and risk.
- Diversification reduces idiosyncratic (firm-specific) risk but not systematic market risk.
- Liquidity matters: less-liquid instruments typically command a liquidity premium.
- Tax and regulatory treatments alter after-tax returns and suitability for different investors.

Key metrics and concepts:

- Yield to maturity (YTM), current yield
- Duration and convexity (interest-rate sensitivity)
- Volatility and beta (equity risk)
- Credit spreads and default probability
- Sharpe ratio, tracking error for funds

---

## Practical guidance

- Match instrument selection to investment horizon and liquidity needs.
- Use diversification (across assets, sectors, geographies) to manage risk.
- Understand fees, tax implications, and counterparty exposures.
- When using derivatives, manage leverage and margin requirements carefully.

## Further reading and resources

- Standard textbooks: Bodie, Kane, and Marcus; John C. Hull (derivatives); Fabozzi (fixed income).

If you want, I can expand any section into a full chapter (e.g., bond valuation and duration, options basics and payoff diagrams, ETF vs mutual fund comparison) or add short worked examples and simple code snippets for basic valuation formulas.
