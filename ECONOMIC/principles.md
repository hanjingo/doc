# Ten Principles of Economics — Notes and Summary

[TOC]

This document summarizes the "Ten Principles of Economics" as presented by N. Gregory Mankiw, with concise explanations and short examples to make each principle easier to remember and apply. Use this as a study aid or quick reference.

## 1. People face trade-offs

Making decisions requires trading off one goal against another. Choosing more of one thing usually means having less of another.

Example: A student choosing to spend time studying for an exam must trade off leisure or part-time work time.

## 2. The cost of something is what you give up to get it (opportunity cost)

The true cost of any choice is the value of the best alternative forgone. Opportunity cost includes time, money, and other resources.

Example: The opportunity cost of attending college includes tuition, fees, and the income foregone by not working full-time.

## 3. Rational people think at the margin

Rational individuals make decisions by comparing marginal benefits and marginal costs — the additional gains or losses from a small incremental change.

Example: A firm considers whether producing one more unit raises profit (marginal revenue > marginal cost).

## 4. People respond to incentives

Behavior changes when costs or benefits change. Incentives (prices, taxes, subsidies, regulations) influence choices.

Example: Higher cigarette taxes reduce smoking by raising the price and creating a financial incentive to quit.

## 5. Trade can make everyone better off

Trade allows people and countries to specialize in activities in which they have a comparative advantage, increasing total output and consumption possibilities.

Example: If Country A is better at producing wine and Country B at producing cloth, both can benefit by specializing and trading.

## 6. Markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity

In many cases, decentralized markets allocate resources efficiently through the price mechanism: buyers and sellers, acting in self-interest, coordinate production and distribution.

Caveat: Markets fail in some cases (externalities, public goods, market power), and institutions or policies may be needed to improve outcomes.

## 7. Governments can sometimes improve market outcomes

When markets fail (externalities or market power) or when redistribution is desirable, well-designed government intervention (taxes, subsidies, regulation, public provision) can increase social welfare.

Example: Pollution taxes internalize external costs, aligning private incentives with social welfare.

## 8. A country's standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods and services

Differences in living standards across countries primarily reflect differences in productivity — the amount of goods and services produced per unit of labor, capital, and technology.

Policy implications: Investing in education, physical capital, infrastructure, and technology raises productivity and long-run living standards.

## 9. Prices rise when the government prints too much money (inflation)

In the long run, inflation is fundamentally a monetary phenomenon: large increases in the money supply tend to raise the overall price level.

Short-run trade-offs exist between inflation and unemployment, but persistent high inflation erodes purchasing power and creates uncertainty.

## 10. Society faces a short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment

In the short run, policies that boost demand can reduce unemployment but may raise inflation (and vice versa). This trade-off is often illustrated by the Phillips curve.

Note: The short-run trade-off is not permanent — in the long run, expectations adjust and the economy returns to its natural rate of unemployment.

## Applying the Principles — quick checklist

- Identify the trade-offs in any decision.
- Compute opportunity costs for major choices.
- Consider marginal changes, not only averages.
- Anticipate how incentives will change behavior.
- Use trade and specialization to increase overall welfare.
- Check for market failures before assuming markets will allocate efficiently.
- Think about long-run productivity when evaluating economic policy.
