## Behavior Question

#### Tell me a little bit about yourself?

I'm a C++ software engineer with 8 years of experience, mainly focused on building performance-critical backend systems. I hold a bachelor's degree in Information and Computing Science and have worked at companies like xx and xx, where I was responsible for core backend components rather than peripheral features. Over the past 4 years as a senior developer, I’ve specialized in distributed systems and network programming. Some of my key contributions include developing cross-platform desktop applications and high-performance network frameworks that increased data processing throughput by around 30%, as well as designing a distributed storage system that reduced storage costs by 30%. I also contributed critical bug fixes to the open-source Protobuf C library, improving cross-platform stability for hundreds of developers. In addition, I led a 5-person engineering team, where I handled sprint planning and made architectural decisions related to performance and reliability. I'm particularly interested in this role because of your work in xx, and I believe my experience with C++ and distributed systems would allow me to contribute quickly and effectively to your engineering team.

#### How did you hear about the position (how did you find this job opening



#### Why are you interested in this position?

I'm interested in this position because it closely matches both my technical background and the problems your team is trying to solve. From the job description, I understand that you're looking for someone with strong experience in xx, especially in areas like xx, which I’ve been working on extensively over the past several years. I've also been following your company’s work in xx, and I find it particularly compelling because it involves solving real, large-scale engineering problems rather than just incremental feature development. In my previous roles, I’ve worked in similar environments, where my skills in xx helped improve performance and system reliability, and I believe I could contribute in a similar way here. Beyond the technical fit, I see this role as a great opportunity to grow alongside the company while working on meaningful and technically challenging projects.

#### Why do you want to move to (XX country)?



#### Why do you want to leave your current/last company?

I’m very grateful for the opportunities I had at my previous company. I was able to grow significantly there, especially in areas like C++ backend development, system performance optimization, and working on production-level projects. Over time, I reached a point where the core technical challenges in my role became more stable and incremental, and there were fewer opportunities to work on larger-scale or more complex systems. At this stage of my career, I’m looking for an environment where I can continue to grow by tackling deeper technical challenges and contributing at a broader system level. After learning more about your company and the kinds of problems you’re solving, I feel this role aligns very well with my background and the direction I want to develop in. I believe my experience in C++ and system-level development would allow me to add value while continuing to grow professionally.

#### Why should we hire you?



#### What's your expected salary/package?

Based on the job description and my understanding of the market, the posted range of $X to $Y seems reasonable for this role in this location. Given my background in C++ and my experience working on performance-critical systems, I would expect to be toward the middle to upper part of that range. That said, I’m flexible and would like to consider the overall package, including responsibilities, growth opportunities, and benefits. Once I have a clearer picture of the role and expectations, I’d be happy to discuss specific numbers in more detail.

#### What do you consider your strengths and weaknesses?



#### Tell me about a time when you overcame a challenge at work



#### Tell me about a time when you had a conflict with a co-worker.



#### Tell me about a time you met a tight deadline.



#### Tell me about a problem you've had getting along with a work associate.



#### Talk about a project you are most passionate about, or one where you did your best work.



#### What are your career goals

In the short term, my goal is to fully understand the systems I’m working on and become a strong contributor to the team, especially in areas related to C++ backend development, system performance, and reliability. I want to take ownership of core components and consistently deliver high-quality, maintainable solutions. In the medium term, I’d like to grow into a role where I can influence system design and technical decisions more broadly, such as architecture, performance optimization, and mentoring junior engineers. I enjoy solving complex problems and sharing best practices within a team. In the long term, my goal is to remain deeply involved in technical work while having a meaningful impact on the overall direction of the systems I build. I see myself as a senior or principal-level engineer who helps drive technical excellence and long-term stability, rather than moving away from hands-on engineering.

#### What is the most challenging aspect of your current project?



#### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?



#### Why do you want to work here?



#### What words would your colleagues use to describe you?



#### Could you share your top consideration when you look for a job? For example, when you get several offers from these companies, what do you think about most? Salary? Location? and something else?



#### What's your ideal working environment?

I work best in collaborative environments with clear communication, strong engineering standards, and a culture that values ownership and continuous improvement.

#### Do you have any questions for me?

Based on what we’ve discussed so far, I’d love to hear what you think are the biggest challenges for someone stepping into this role.

#### What do you want to do with your life?
