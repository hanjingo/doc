- **Human error or mistake**: Human behavior that results in the introduction of faults into a system.
- **Risk**: This is a measure of the probability that the system will cause an accident.
- **System error**: An erroneous system state that can lead to system behavior that is unexpected by system users.
- **System failure**: An event that occurs at some point in time when the system does not deliver a service as expected by its users. No weather data is transmitted because the time is invalid.
- **System fault**: A characteristic of a software system that can lead to a system error.
- **Threats**:
