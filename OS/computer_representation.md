# Computer Representation

[TOC]

Computer representations use a limited number of bits to encode a number, and hence some operations can `overflow` when the results are too large to be represented. This can lead to some surprising results.

`little endian`. where the least significant byte comes first.

`big endian`. where the most significant byte comes first.
